to chip, kathy, and nancy, who graciously shared your father with a nation that loved him; to walter's friends, colleagues, protégés, and all who considered him a hero; to the men of the intrepid; to all of you who are gathered here today; i am honored to be here to pay tribute to the life and times of the man who chronicled our time.
i did not know mr. cronkite personally.
and my regret is made more acute by the stories that have been shared here today.
nor, for that matter, did i know him any better than the tens of millions who turned to him each night in search of the answer to a simple question:  "what happened today?"
but like them
and like all of you, i have benefited as a citizen from his dogged pursuit of the truth, his passionate defense of objective reporting, and his view that journalism is more than just a profession; it is a public good vital to our democracy.
even in his early career, walter cronkite resisted the temptation to get the story first in favor of getting it right.
he wanted to get it first, but he understood the importance of getting it right.
during one of his first jobs in kansas city, walter's program manager urged him to go on the air reporting a massive blaze -- and we just heard how much he loved fires -- a massive blaze at city hall that had already claimed lives.
when walter reached for the telephone, his boss asked, "what are you doing; get on the air!"
walter replied that he was calling the fire department to confirm the story.
"you don't need to confirm it," the manager shouted, "my wife is watching the whole thing!"
needless to say, walter made the call, and even as the program manager took to the air himself to broadcast the unfolding tragedy, walter discovered that it had been nothing more than a small fire that hadn't resulted in any injuries.
he lost his job -- but he got the story right.
walter wasn't afraid to rattle the high and the mighty, either; but he never dared to compromise his integrity.
he got along with elected officials, even if they were wary of one another's motives.
one politician once remarked, "walter, my friend, you've got to believe me, fully 85 percent of everything i told you today is the absolute truth."
he shared a complicated relationship with presidents of both parties, who wanted him on their side even as they were convinced that he wasn't.
president johnson called walter after the evening news from time to time to voice his displeasure over a certain story.
but walter knew that if he was receiving vociferous complaints from both sides, he must be doing his job.
his endless inquisitiveness about our world, i can imagine, came from a mother who sold encyclopedias for a living.
as a boy, walter spent countless hours getting lost within their pages, endlessly sidetracked by new and interesting entries that branched off from one another, fascinated by the world around us and how it worked.
and that's the way he lived his life -- with curiosity, exploring our planet, seeking to make sense of it and explaining it to others.
he went everywhere and he did everything.
he raced cars and boats; he traveled everywhere from the amazon to the arctic; he plunged 8,000 feet below the sea, trekked 18,000 feet up into the himalayas, and experienced weightlessness in the upper reaches of our atmosphere -- all with one mission:  to make it come alive for the rest of us.
and as our world began to change, he helped us understand those changes.
he was forever there, reporting through world war and cold war; marches and milestones; scandal and success; calmly and authoritatively telling us what we needed to know.
he was a voice of certainty in a world that was growing more and more uncertain.
and through it all, he never lost the integrity or the plainspoken speaking style that he gained growing up in the heartland.
he was a familiar and welcome voice that spoke to each and every one of us personally.
so it may have seemed inevitable that he was named the most trusted man in america.
but here's the thing:
that title wasn't bestowed on him by a network.
we weren't told to believe it by some advertising campaign.
it was earned.
it was earned by year after year and decade after decade of painstaking effort; a commitment to fundamental values; his belief that the american people were hungry for the truth, unvarnished and unaccompanied by theatre or spectacle.
he didn't believe in dumbing down.
he trusted us.
when he was told of this extraordinary honor that he was the most trusted man in america, he naturally downplayed it by saying the people had not polled his wife.
when people of both political parties actually tried to recruit him to run for office, without even asking for his stances on the issues, he said no -- to the relief of all potential opponents.
and when, even a decade and a half after his retirement, he still ranked first in seven of eight categories for television journalists, he was disbelieving that he hadn't won the eighth category, "attractiveness."
through all the events that came to define the 20th century, through all our moments of deepest hurt and brightest hope, walter cronkite was there, telling the story of the american age.
and this is how we remember him today.
but we also remember and celebrate the journalism that walter practiced -- a standard of honesty and integrity and responsibility to which so many of you have committed your careers.
it's a standard
that's a little bit harder to find today.
we know that this is a difficult time for journalism.
even as appetites for news and information grow, newsrooms are closing.
despite the big stories of our era, serious journalists find themselves all too often without a beat.
just as the news cycle has shrunk, so has the bottom line.
and too often, we fill that void with instant commentary and celebrity gossip and the softer stories that walter disdained, rather than the hard news and investigative journalism
he championed.
"what happened today?" is replaced with "who won today?"
the public debate cheapens.
the public trust falters.
we fail to understand our world or one another as well as we should –- and that has real consequences in our own lives and in the life of our nation.
we seem stuck with a choice between what cuts to our bottom line and what harms us as a society.
which price is higher to pay?
which cost is harder to bear?
"this democracy," walter said, "cannot function without a reasonably well-informed electorate.
"
that's why the honest, objective, meticulous reporting that so many of you pursue with the same zeal that walter did is so vital to our democracy and our society:
our future depends on it.
walter was no naive idealist.
he understood the challenges and the pressures and the temptations facing journalism in this new era.
he believed that a media company has an obligation to pursue a profit, but also an obligation to invest a good chunk of that profit back into news and public affairs.
he was excited about all the stories that a high-tech world of journalism would be able to tell, and all the newly-emerging means with which to tell it.
naturally, we find ourselves wondering how he would have covered the monumental stories of our time.
in an era where the news that city hall is on fire can sweep around the world at the speed of the internet, would he still have called to double-check?
would he have been able to cut through the murky noise of the blogs and the tweets and the sound bites to shine the bright light on substance?
would he still offer the perspective that we value?
would he have been able to remain a singular figure in an age of dwindling attention spans and omnipresent media?
and somehow, we know that the answer is yes.
the simple values walter cronkite set out in pursuit of -- to seek the truth, to keep us honest, to explore our world the best he could -- they are as vital today as they ever were.
our american story continues.
it needs to be told.
and if we choose to live up to walter's example, if we realize that the kind of journalism he embodied will not simply rekindle itself as part of a natural cycle, but will come alive only if we stand up and demand it and resolve to value it once again, then i'm convinced that the choice between profit and progress is a false one -- and that the golden days of journalism still lie ahead.
walter cronkite invited a nation to believe in him -- and he never betrayed that trust.
that's why so many of you entered the profession in the first place.
that's why the standards he set for journalists still stand.
and that's why he loved and valued all of you, but we loved and valued walter not only as the rarest of men, but as an indispensable pillar of our society.
he's reunited with his beloved betsy now, watching the stories of this century unfold with boundless optimism -- every so often punctuating the air with a gleeful "oh, boy!"
we are grateful to him for altering and illuminating our time, and for the opportunity he gave to us to say that, yes, we, too, were there.
thank you very much.
hello, everybody!
thank you.
thank you.
thank you, everybody.
all right, everybody go ahead and have a seat.
how is everybody doing today?
how about tim spicer?
i am here with students at wakefield high school in arlington, virginia.
and we've got students tuning in from all across america, from kindergarten through 12th grade.
and i am just so glad that all could join us today.
and i want to thank wakefield for being such an outstanding host.
give yourselves a big round of applause.
i know that for many of you, today is the first day of school.
and for those of you in kindergarten, or starting middle or high school, it's your first day in a new school, so it's understandable if you're a little nervous.
i imagine there are some seniors out there who are feeling pretty good right now -- with just one more year to go.
and no matter what grade you're in, some of you are probably wishing it were still summer
and you could've stayed in bed just a little bit longer this morning.
i know that feeling.
when i was young, my family lived overseas.
i lived in indonesia for a few years.
and my mother, she didn't have the money to send me where all the american kids went to school, but she thought it was important for me to keep up with an american education.
so she decided to teach me extra lessons herself, monday through friday.
but because she had to go to work, the only time she could do it was at 4:30 in the morning.
now, as you might imagine, i wasn't too happy about getting up that early.
and a lot of times, i'd fall asleep right there at the kitchen table.
but whenever i'd complain, my mother would just give me one of those looks
and she'd say, "this is no picnic for me either, buster.
"
so i know that some of you are still adjusting to being back at school.
but i'm here today because i have something important to discuss with you.
i'm here because i want to talk with you about your education and what's expected of all of you in this new school year.
now, i've given a lot of speeches about education.
and i've talked about responsibility a lot.
i've talked about teachers' responsibility for inspiring students and pushing you to learn.
i've talked about your parents' responsibility for making sure you stay on track, and you get your homework done, and don't spend every waking hour in front of the tv or with the xbox.
i've talked a lot about your government's responsibility for setting high standards, and supporting teachers and principals, and turning around schools that aren't working, where students aren't getting the opportunities that they deserve.
but at the end of the day, we can have the most dedicated teachers, the most supportive parents, the best schools in the world -- and none of it will make a difference, none of it will matter unless all of you fulfill your responsibilities, unless you show up to those schools, unless you pay attention to those teachers, unless you listen to your parents and grandparents and other adults and put in the hard work it takes to succeed.
that's what i want to focus on today: the responsibility each of you has for your education.
i want to start with the responsibility you have to yourself.
every single one of you has something that you're good at.
every single one of you has something to offer.
and you have a responsibility to yourself to discover what that is.
that's the opportunity an education can provide.
maybe you could be a great writer
-- maybe even good enough to write a book or articles in a newspaper -- but you might not know it until you write that english paper --
that english class paper that's assigned to you.
maybe you could be an innovator or an inventor -- maybe even good enough to come up with the next iphone or the new medicine or vaccine -- but you might not know it until you do your project for your science class.
maybe you could be a mayor or a senator or a supreme court justice -- but you might not know that until you join student government or the debate team.
and no matter what you want to do with your life, i guarantee that you'll need an education to do it.
you want to be a doctor, or a teacher, or a police officer?
you want to be a nurse or an architect, a lawyer or a member of our military?
you're going to need a good education for every single one of those careers.
you cannot drop out of school and just drop into a good job.
you've got to train for it and work for it and learn for it.
and this isn't just important for your own life and your own future.
what you make of your education will decide nothing less than the future of this country.
the future of america depends on you.
what you're learning in school today will determine whether we as a nation can meet our greatest challenges in the future.
you'll need the knowledge and problem-solving skills you learn in science and math to cure diseases like cancer and aids, and to develop new energy technologies and protect our environment.
you'll need the insights and critical-thinking skills you gain in history and social studies to fight poverty and homelessness, crime and discrimination, and make our nation more fair and more free.
you'll need the creativity and ingenuity you develop in all your classes to build new companies that will create new jobs and boost our economy.
we need every single one of you to develop your talents and your skills and your intellect
so you can help us old folks solve our most difficult problems.
if you don't do that --
if you quit on school -- you're not just quitting on yourself, you're quitting on your country.
now, i know it's not always easy to do well in school.
i know a lot of you have challenges in your lives right now that can make it hard to focus on your schoolwork.
i get it.
i know what it's like.
my father left my family when i was two years old, and i was raised by a single mom who had to work and who struggled at times to pay the bills and wasn't always able to give us the things that other kids had.
there were times when i missed having a father in my life.
there were times when i was lonely
and i felt like i didn't fit in.
so i wasn't always as focused as i should have been on school, and i did some things i'm not proud of, and i got in more trouble than i should have.
and my life could have easily taken a turn for the worse.
but i was --
i was lucky.
i got a lot of second chances, and i had the opportunity to go to college and law school and follow my dreams.
my wife, our first lady michelle obama, she has a similar story.
neither of her parents had gone to college, and they didn't have a lot of money.
but they worked hard, and she worked hard, so that she could go to the best schools in this country.
some of you might not have those advantages.
maybe you don't have adults in your life who give you the support that you need.
maybe someone in your family has lost their job and there's not enough money to go around.
maybe you live in a neighborhood where you don't feel safe, or have friends who are pressuring you to do things you know aren't right.
but at the end of the day, the circumstances of your life -- what you look like, where you come from, how much money you have, what you've got going on at home -- none of that is an excuse for neglecting your homework or having a bad attitude in school.
that's no excuse for talking back to your teacher, or cutting class, or dropping out of school.
there is no excuse for not trying.
where you are right now doesn't have to determine where you'll end up.
no one's written your destiny for you, because here in america, you write your own destiny.
you make your own future.
that's what young people like you are doing every day, all across america.
young people like jazmin perez, from roma, texas.
jazmin didn't speak english when she first started school.
neither of her parents had gone to college.
but she worked hard, earned good grades, and got a scholarship to brown university -- is now in graduate school, studying public health, on her way to becoming dr. jazmin perez.
i'm thinking about andoni schultz, from los altos, california, who's fought brain cancer since he was three.
he's had to endure all sorts of treatments and surgeries, one of which affected his memory, so it took him much longer -- hundreds of extra hours -- to do his schoolwork.
but he never fell behind.
he's headed to college this fall.
and then there's shantell steve, from my hometown of chicago, illinois.
even when bouncing from foster home to foster home in the toughest neighborhoods in the city, she managed to get a job at a local health care center, start a program to keep young people out of gangs, and she's on track to graduate high school with honors and go on to college.
and jazmin, andoni, and shantell aren't any different from any of you.
they face challenges in their lives just like you do.
in some cases they've got it a lot worse off than many of you.
but they refused to give up.
they chose to take responsibility for their lives, for their education, and set goals for themselves.
and i expect all of you to do the same.
that's why today i'm calling on each of you to set your own goals for your education -- and do everything you can to meet them.
your goal can be something as simple as doing all your homework, paying attention in class, or spending some time each day reading a book.
maybe you'll decide to get involved in an extracurricular activity, or volunteer in your community.
maybe you'll decide to stand up for kids who are being teased or bullied because of who they are or how they look, because you believe, like i do, that all young people deserve a safe environment to study and learn.
maybe you'll decide to take better care of yourself
so you can be more ready to learn.
and along those lines, by the way, i hope all of you are washing your hands a lot, and that you stay home from school when you don't feel well, so we can keep people from getting the flu this fall and winter.
but whatever you resolve to do, i want you to commit to it.
i want you to really work at it.
i know that sometimes you get that sense from tv that you can be rich and successful without any hard work -- that your ticket to success is through rapping or basketball or being a reality tv star.
chances are you're not going to be any of those things.
the truth is, being successful is hard.
you won't love every subject that you study.
you won't click with every teacher that you have.
not every homework assignment will seem completely relevant to your life right at this minute.
and you won't necessarily succeed at everything the first time you try.
that's okay.
some of the most successful people in the world are the ones who've had the most failures.
j.k.
rowling's -- who wrote harry potter --
her first harry potter book was rejected 12 times before it was finally published.
michael jordan was cut from his high school basketball team.
he lost hundreds of games and missed thousands of shots during his career.
but he once said, "i have failed over and over and over again in my life.
and that's why i succeed.
"
these people succeeded because they understood that you can't let your failures define you -- you have to let your failures teach you.
you have to let them show you what to do differently the next time.
so if you get into trouble, that doesn't mean you're a troublemaker, it means you need to try harder to act right.
if you get a bad grade, that doesn't mean you're stupid, it just means you need to spend more time studying.
no one's born being good at all things.
you become good at things through hard work.
you're not a varsity athlete the first time you play a new sport.
you don't hit every note the first time you sing a song.
you've got to practice.
the same principle applies to your schoolwork.
you might have to do a math problem a few times before you get it right.
you might have to read something a few times before you understand it.
you definitely have to do a few drafts of a paper before it's good enough to hand in.
don't be afraid to ask questions.
don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it.
i do that every day.
asking for help isn't a sign of weakness, it's a sign of strength because it shows you have the courage to admit when you don't know something, and that then allows you to learn something new.
so find an adult that you trust --
a parent, a grandparent or teacher, a coach or a counselor -- and ask them to help you stay on track to meet your goals.
and even when you're struggling, even when you're discouraged, and you feel like other people have given up on you, don't ever give up on yourself, because when you give up on yourself, you give up on your country.
the story of america isn't about people who quit when things got tough.
it's about people who kept going, who tried harder, who loved their country too much to do anything less than their best.
it's the story of students who sat where you sit 250 years ago, and went on to wage a revolution
and they founded this nation.
young people.
students who sat where you sit 75 years ago who overcame a depression and won a world war; who fought for civil rights and put a man on the moon.
students who sat where you sit 20 years ago who founded google and twitter and facebook and changed the way we communicate with each other.
so today, i want to ask all of you, what's your contribution going to be?
what problems are you going to solve?
what discoveries will you make?
what will a president who comes here in 20 or 50 or 100 years say about what all of you did for this country?
now, your families, your teachers, and i are doing everything we can to make sure you have the education you need to answer these questions.
i'm working hard to fix up your classrooms and get you the books and the equipment and the computers you need to learn.
but you've got to do your part, too.
so i expect all of you to get serious this year.
i expect you to put your best effort into everything you do.
i expect great things from each of you.
so don't let us down.
don't let your family down or your country down.
most of all, don't let yourself down.
make us all proud.
thank you very much, everybody.
god bless you.
god bless america.
thank you.
your eminence, vicki, kara, edward, patrick, curran, caroline, members of the kennedy family, distinguished guests, and fellow citizens:
today we say goodbye to the youngest child of rose and joseph kennedy.
the world will long remember their son edward as the heir to a weighty legacy; a champion for those who had none; the soul of the democratic party; and the lion of the u.s. senate - a man whose name graces nearly one thousand laws, and who penned more than three hundred himself.
but those of us who loved him, and ache with his passing, know ted kennedy by the other titles he held: father.
brother.
husband.
uncle teddy, or as he was often known to his younger nieces and nephews, "the grand fromage," or "the big cheese.
" i, like so many others in the city where he worked for nearly half a century, knew him as a colleague, a mentor, and above all, a friend.
ted kennedy was the baby of the family who became its patriarch; the restless dreamer who became its rock.
he was the sunny, joyful child, who bore the brunt of his brothers' teasing, but learned quickly how to brush it off.
when they tossed him off a boat because he didn't know what a jib was, six-year-old teddy got back in and learned to sail.
when a photographer asked the newly-elected bobby to step back at a press conference because he was casting a shadow on his younger brother, teddy quipped, "it'll be the same in washington."
this spirit of resilience and good humor would see ted kennedy through more pain and tragedy than most of us will ever know.
he lost two siblings by the age of sixteen.
he saw two more taken violently from the country that loved them.
he said goodbye to his beloved sister, eunice, in the final days of his own life.
he narrowly survived a plane crash, watched two children struggle with cancer, buried three nephews, and experienced personal failings and setbacks in the most public way possible.
it is a string of events that would have broken a lesser man.
and it would have been easy for teddy to let himself become bitter and hardened; to surrender to self-pity and regret; to retreat from public life and live out his years in peaceful quiet.
no one would have blamed him for that.
but that was not ted kennedy.
as he told us, "...
[i]ndividual faults and frailties are no excuse to give in - and no exemption from the common obligation to give of ourselves."
indeed, ted was the "happy warrior" that the poet william wordsworth spoke of when he wrote:

as tempted more; more able to endure,

as more exposed to suffering and distress;

thence, also, more alive to tenderness.
through his own suffering, ted kennedy became more alive to the plight and suffering of others - the sick child who could not see a doctor; the young soldier sent to battle without armor; the citizen denied her rights because of what she looks like or who she loves or where she comes from.
the landmark laws that he championed -- the civil rights act, the americans with disabilities act, immigration reform, children's health care, the family and medical leave act -all have a running thread.
ted kennedy's life's work was not to champion those with wealth or power or special connections.
it was to give a voice to those who were not heard; to add a rung to the ladder of opportunity; to make real the dream of our founding.
he was given the gift of time that his brothers were not, and he used that gift to touch as many lives and right as many wrongs as the years would allow.
we can still hear his voice bellowing through the senate chamber, face reddened, fist pounding the podium, a veritable force of nature, in support of health care or workers' rights or civil rights.
and yet, while his causes became deeply personal, his disagreements never did.
while he was seen by his fiercest critics as a partisan lightning rod, that is not the prism through which ted kennedy saw the world, nor was it the prism through which his colleagues saw him.
he was a product of an age when the joy and nobility of politics prevented differences of party and philosophy from becoming barriers to cooperation and mutual respect - a time when adversaries still saw each other as patriots.
and that's how ted kennedy became the greatest legislator of our time.
he did it by hewing to principle, but also by seeking compromise and common cause - not through deal-making and horse-trading alone, but through friendship, and kindness, and humor.
there was the time he courted orrin hatch's support for the children's health insurance program by having his chief of staff serenade the senator with a song orrin had written himself; the time he delivered shamrock cookies on a china plate to sweeten up a crusty republican colleague; and the famous story of how he won the support of a texas committee chairman on an immigration bill.
teddy walked into a meeting with a plain manila envelope, and showed only the chairman that it was filled with the texan's favorite cigars.
when the negotiations were going well, he would inch the envelope closer to the chairman.
when they weren't, he would pull it back.
before long, the deal was done.
it was only a few years ago, on st. patrick's day, when teddy buttonholed me on the floor of the senate for my support on a certain piece of legislation that was coming up for vote.
i gave him my pledge, but expressed my skepticism that it would pass.
but when the roll call was over, the bill garnered the votes it needed, and then some.
i looked at teddy with astonishment and asked how he had pulled it off.
he just patted me on the back, and said "luck of the irish!"
of course, luck had little to do with ted kennedy's legislative success, and he knew that.
a few years ago, his father-in-law told him that he and daniel webster just might be the two greatest senators of all time.
without missing a beat, teddy replied, "what did webster do?"
but though it is ted kennedy's historic body of achievements we will remember, it is his giving heart that we will miss.
it was the friend and colleague who was always the first to pick up the phone and say, "i'm sorry for your loss,"
or "i hope you feel better," or "what can i do to help?
" it was the boss who was so adored by his staff that over five hundred spanning five decades showed up for his 75th birthday party.
it was the man who sent birthday wishes and thank you notes and even his own paintings to so many who never imagined that a u.s. senator would take the time to think about someone like them.
i have one of those paintings in my private study - a cape cod seascape that was a gift to a freshman legislator who happened to admire it when ted kennedy welcomed him into his office the first week he arrived in washington; by the way, that's my second favorite gift from teddy and vicki after our dog bo.
and it seems like everyone has one of those stories - the ones that often start with "you wouldn't believe who called me today."
ted kennedy was the father who looked after not only his own three children, but john's and bobby's as well.
he took them camping and taught them to sail.
he laughed and danced with them at birthdays and weddings; cried and mourned with them through hardship and tragedy; and passed on that same sense of service and selflessness that his parents had instilled in him.
shortly after ted walked caroline down the aisle and gave her away at the altar, he received a note from jackie that read, "on you the carefree youngest brother fell a burden
a hero would have begged to be spared.
we are all going to make it because you were always there with your love."
not only did the kennedy family make it because of ted's love - he made it because of theirs; and especially because of the love and the life he found in vicki.
after so much loss and so much sorrow, it could not have been easy for ted kennedy to risk his heart again.
that he did is a testament to how deeply he loved this remarkable woman from louisiana.
and she didn't just love him back.
as ted would often acknowledge, vicki saved him.
she gave him strength and purpose; joy and friendship; and stood by him always, especially in those last, hardest days.
we cannot know for certain how long we have here.
we cannot foresee the trials or misfortunes that will test us along the way.
we cannot know god's plan for us.
what we can do is to live out our lives as best we can with purpose, and love, and joy.
we can use each day to show those who are closest to us how much we care about them, and treat others with the kindness and respect that we wish for ourselves.
we can learn from our mistakes and grow from our failures.
and we can strive at all costs to make a better world, so that someday, if we are blessed with the chance to look back on our time here, we can know that we spent it well; that we made a difference; that our fleeting presence had a lasting impact on the lives of other human beings.
this is how ted kennedy lived.
this is his legacy.
he once said of his brother bobby that he need not be idealized or enlarged in death beyond what he was in life, and i imagine he would say the same about himself.
the greatest expectations were placed upon ted kennedy's shoulders because of who he was, but he surpassed them all because of who he became.
we do not weep for him today because of the prestige attached to his name or his office.
we weep because we loved this kind and tender hero who persevered through pain and tragedy - not for the sake of ambition or vanity; not for wealth or power; but only for the people and the country he loved.
in the days after september 11th, teddy made it a point to personally call each one of the 177 families of this state who lost a loved one in the attack.
but he didn't stop there.
he kept calling and checking up on them.
he fought through red tape to get them assistance and grief counseling.
he invited them sailing, played with their children, and would write each family a letter whenever the anniversary of that terrible day came along.
to one widow, he wrote the following:

"as you know
so well, the passage of time never really heals the tragic memory of such a great loss, but we carry on, because we have to, because our loved one would want us to, and because there is still light to guide us in the world from the love they gave us."
we carry on.
ted kennedy has gone home now, guided by his faith and by the light of those he has loved and lost.
at last he is with them once more, leaving those of us who grieve his passing with the memories he gave, the good he did, the dream he kept alive, and a single, enduring image - the image of a man on a boat; white mane tousled; smiling broadly as he sails into the wind, ready for what storms may come, carrying on toward some new and wondrous place just beyond the horizon.
may god bless ted kennedy, and may he rest in eternal peace.
hello, michigan!
thank you.
thank you so much.
first of all, give joe a big round of applause for the wonderful introduction.
we've got some special guests here -- now, if everybody has chairs, go ahead and use them.
feel free.
we've got some special guests here today that i just want to acknowledge.
all of you are special, but these folks i want to make sure that you have a chance to see them.
first of all, one of the best governors in the country, please give jennifer granholm a big round of applause.
lieutenant governor john cherry -- give john a big round of applause.
one of my favorite people, a former colleague of mine, still just a fighter on behalf of working families each and every day -- senator debbie stabenow.
we've got speaker of the house, andy dillon, in the house.
we've got a lot of other local elected officials, and i just want to thank them.
a couple of people who are missing:  carl levin, who is doing great work.
he's in the senate right now fighting on behalf of a bill to make sure that we're not loading up a bunch of necessary defense spending with unnecessary defense spending.
so he's the point person on it.
the only reason he's not here is because he is working alongside the administration to get this bill done.
please give him a big round of applause.
congressman sandy levin, also working hard on your behalf each and every day, but is not here today.
i want to go ahead and acknowledge the new mayor, since he's the new mayor -- mayor dave bing, great ball player.
my game is a little like dave bing's -- except i don't have the jump shot or the speed or the ball handling skills -- or the endurance.
also don't have the afro.
don't think i forgot that, dave.
i remember.
i remember that.
i also want to acknowledge that we've got the executive director of the white house council on auto communities and workers, who's working hard, has a direct line to me each and every day.
he's traveling constantly back here --
ed montgomery.
please give ed a big round of applause.
and the chairman of the grand traverse band of ottawa and chippewa indian tribe, derek bailey is here.
please give derek a big round of applause.
and finally, the president of the college where we are here, jim jacobs.
give jim jacobs a big round of applause.
and those of you who i've missed
, you know how grateful i am that you're here.
and thank you all.
it is wonderful to be back at macomb.
it was terrific visiting this campus as a candidate, but i have to admit, it's even better visiting as a president.
now, this is a place where anyone -- anyone with a desire to learn and to grow, to take their career to a new level or start a new career altogether -- has the opportunity to pursue their dream, right here in macomb.
this is a place where people of all ages and all backgrounds -- even in the face of obstacles, even in the face of very difficult personal challenges -- can take a chance on a brighter future for themselves and their families.
there are folks like joe, who just told us his story.
when joe lost his job, he decided to take advantage of assistance for displaced workers.
he earned his associate degree here at macomb, and with a pretty impressive gpa, i might add.
and with the help of that degree, joe found a new job, working for the new henry ford west bloomfield hospital as a maintenance mechanic, using the skills he learned here and the talents that he brought to make a fresh start.
there are workers like kellie kulman, who is here today.
where's kellie?
raise your hand, kellie.
where are you?
there you are.
there's kellie right there.
kellie is a uaw worker at a ford plant in sterling heights, michigan.
she used to drive a fork lift, right?
but then she decided to train here at macomb for a job that required new skills, and now she's an apprentice pipe fitter.
it's a telling example:  even as this painful restructuring takes place in our auto industry, workers are seeking out training for new auto jobs.
and joe and kellie's story make clear what all of you know:
community colleges are an essential part of our recovery in the present -- and our prosperity in the future.
this place can make the future better, not just for these individuals but for america.
now, since this recession began 20 months ago, 6.5 million americans have lost their jobs, and i don't have to tell you michigan in particular has been hard-hit.
now, i -- the statistics are daunting.
the whole country now, the unemployment rate is approaching 10 percent.
here in michigan, it's about five points higher.
and new jobs of course are going to be coming out
and we're going to see continuing job loss even as the economy is beginning to stabilize.
now, that's not just abstractions.
those just aren't numbers on a page.
those are extraordinary hardships, tough times, for families and individuals who've worked hard all their lives and have done the right things all their lives.
if you haven't lost a job, chances are you know somebody who has:  a family member, a neighbor, a friend, a coworker.
and you know that as difficult as the financial struggle can be, the sense of loss is about more than just a paycheck, because most of us define ourselves by the work we do.
that's part of what it means to be an american.
we take pride in work -- that sense that you're contributing, supporting your family, meeting your responsibilities.
people need work not just for income, but because it makes you part of that fabric of a community that's so important.
and so when you lose your job, and when entire communities are losing thousands of jobs, that's a heavy burden
, that's a heavy weight.
now, my administration has a job to do, as well, and that job is to get this economy back on its feet.
that's my job.
and it's a job i gladly accept.
i love these folks who helped get us in this mess and then suddenly say, well, this is obama's economy.
that's fine.
give it to me.
my job is to solve problems, not to stand on the sidelines and harp and gripe.
so i welcome the job.
i want the responsibility.
and i know
that -- let's just take an example.
many questioned our efforts to help save gm and chrysler from collapse earlier this year.
their feeling was these companies were driven to the brink by poor management decisions over a long period of time, and like any business they should be held accountable for those decisions.
i agree that they should be held accountable.
but i also recognize the historic significance and economic prominence of these companies in communities all across michigan and all across the country.
i thought about the hundreds of thousands of americans whose livelihoods are still connected to the american auto industry, and the impact on an already struggling economy, especially right here in michigan.
so i said that if chrysler and gm were willing to fundamentally restructure their businesses and make the hard choices necessary to become competitive now and in the future, it was a process worth supporting.
now today, after a painful period of soul-searching and sacrifice, both gm and chrysler have emerged from bankruptcy.
remember, folks said there was no way they could do it?
they've gotten it done already, in record time -- far faster than anybody thought possible.
they've got a leaner structure, they've got new management, and a viable vision of how to compete and win in the 21st century.
those sacrifices were shared among all the stakeholders:  workers and management; creditors and shareholders; retirees and communities.
and together, they've made the rebirth of chrysler and gm possible.
it was the right thing to do.
but even with this positive news, the hard truth is, is that some of the jobs that have been lost in the auto industry and elsewhere won't be coming back.
they're the casualties of a changing economy.
in some cases, just increased productivity in the plants
themselves means that some jobs aren't going to return.
and that only underscores the importance of generating new businesses and new industries to replace the ones that we've lost, and of preparing our workers to fill the jobs they create.
for even before this recession hit, we were faced with an economy that was simply not creating or sustaining enough new, well-paying jobs.
so now is the time to change all that.
what we face is far more than a passing crisis.
this is a transformative moment.
and in this moment we must do what other generations have done.
it's not the time to shrink from the challenges we face or put off tough decisions.
that's what washington has done for decades, and it's exactly why i ran for president -- to change that mindset.
now is the time to build a firmer, stronger foundation for growth that will not only withstand future economic storms, but that will help us thrive and compete in a global economy.
to build that foundation, we have to slow the growth of health care costs that are driving us into debt.
we're going to have to do that, and there's going to be a major debate over the next three weeks.
and don't be fooled by folks trying to scare you, saying we can't change the health care system.
we have no choice but to change the health care system, because right now it's broken for too many americans.
we're going to have to make tough choices necessary to bring down deficits.
but don't let folks fool you -- the best way to start bringing down deficits is to get control of our health care costs,
which is why we need reform.
now is the time to create the jobs of the future by growing industries, including a new clean energy economy.
and jennifer granholm has been all on top of this as the governor of michigan.
she is bring cleaning [sic] energy jobs right here to michigan, and we've got to support her in that effort.
i want michigan to build windmills and wind turbines and solar panels and biofuel plants and energy-efficient light bulbs and weatherize all our -- because, michigan, you know bad weather.
so you can be all on top of weatherizing.
you need to weatherize.
i know about that in chicago too.
but we also have to ensure that we're educating and preparing our people for the new jobs of the 21st century.
we've got to prepare our people with the skills they need to compete in this global economy.
time and again, when we placed our bet for the future on education, we have prospered as a result -- by tapping the incredible innovative and generative potential of a skilled american workforce.
that's what happened when president lincoln signed into law legislation creating the land grant colleges, which not only transformed higher education, but also our entire economy.
that's what took place when president roosevelt signed the gi bill which helped educate a generation, and ushered in an era of unprecedented prosperity.
that was the foundation for the american middle class.
and that's why, at the start of my administration i set a goal for america:  by 2020
, this nation will once again have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world.
we used to have that.
we're going to have it again.
and we've begun to take historic steps to achieve this goal.
already we've increased pell grants by $500.
we've created a $2,500 tax credit for four years of college tuition.
we've simplified student aid applications and ensured that aid is not based on the income of a job that you just lost.
a new gi bill of rights for the 21st century is beginning to help soldiers coming home from iraq and afghanistan to begin a new life -- in a new economy.
and the recovery plan has helped close state budget shortfalls -- which put enormous pressure on public universities and community colleges -- at the same time making historic investments in school libraries and classrooms and facilities all across america.
so we've already taken some steps that are building the foundation for a 21st century education system here in america, one that will allow us to compete with china and india and everybody else all around the world.
but today i'm announcing the most significant down payment yet on reaching the goal of having the highest college graduation rate of any nation in the world.
we're going to achieve this in the next 10 years.
and it's called the american graduation initiative.
it will reform and strengthen community colleges like this one from coast to coast
so they get the resources that students and schools need -- and the results workers and businesses demand.
through this plan, we seek to help an additional 5 million americans earn degrees and certificates in the next decade -- 5 million.
not since the passage of the original gi bill and the work of president truman's commission on higher education -- which helped to double the number of community colleges and increase by seven-fold enrollment in those colleges -- have we taken such a historic step on behalf of community colleges in america.
and let me be clear:  we pay for this plan
-- this isn't adding to the deficit; we're paying for this plan -- by ending the wasteful subsidies we currently provide to banks and private lenders for student loans.
that will save tens of billions of dollars over the next 10 years.
instead of lining the pockets of special interests, it's time this money went towards the interests of higher education in america.
that's what my administration is committed to doing.
now, i know that for a long time there have been politicians who have spoken of training as a silver bullet and college as a cure-all.
it's not, and we know that.
i can't tell you how many workers who've been laid off, you talk to them about training and they say, "training for what?
"
so i understand the frustrations that a lot of people have, especially if the training is not well designed for the specific jobs that are being created out there.
but we know that in the coming years, jobs requiring at least an associate degree are projected to grow twice as fast as jobs requiring no college experience.
we will not fill those jobs -- or even keep those jobs here in america -- without the training offered by community colleges.
that's why i want to applaud governor granholm for the no worker left behind program.
it's providing up to two years' worth of free tuition at community colleges and universities across the state.
the rest of the country should learn from the effort.
this is training to become a medical technician, or a health it worker, or a lab specialist, or a nurse.
in fact, 59 percent of all new nurses come from community colleges.
this is training to install solar panels and build those wind turbines we were talking about and develop a smarter electricity grid.
and this is the kind of education that more and more americans are using to improve their skills and broaden their horizons.
many young people are saving money by spending two years at community college before heading to a four-year college.
and more workers who have lost their jobs -- or fear losing a job -- are seeking an edge at schools like this one.
at the same time, community colleges are under increasing pressure to cap enrollments and scrap courses and cut costs as states and municipalities face budget shortfalls.
and this is in addition to the challenges you face in the best of times, as these schools receive far less funding per student than typical four-year colleges and universities.
so community colleges are an undervalued asset in our country.
not only is that not right, it's not smart.
that's why i've asked dr. jill biden -- who happens to be a relation of the vice president, joe biden, but who is also a community college educator for more than 16 years -- to promote community colleges and help us make community colleges stronger.
and that's why we're putting in place this american graduation initiative.
let me describe for you the specifics of what we're going to do.
number one, we will offer competitive grants, challenging community colleges to pursue innovative, results-oriented strategies in exchange for federal funding.
we'll fund programs that connect students looking for jobs with businesses that are looking to hire.
we'll challenge these schools to find new and better ways to help students catch up on the basics, like math and science, that are essential to our competitiveness.
we'll put colleges and employers together to create programs that match curricula in the classroom with the needs of the boardroom.
these are all kinds of -- there are all kinds of examples of what's possible.
we've seen cisco, for example, working with community colleges to prepare students and workers for jobs ranging from work in broadband to health it.
we know that the most successful community colleges are those that partner with the private sector.
so we want to encourage more companies to work with schools to build these type of relationships.
that way, when somebody goes through a training program, they know that there's a job at the end of that training.
we'll also create a new research center with a simple mission:  to measure what works and what doesn't.
all too often, we don't know what happens when somebody walks out of a classroom and onto the factory floor or into the library or
-- the laboratory or the office.
and that means businesses often can't be sure what a degree is really worth.  and schools themselves don't have the facts to make informed choices about which programs receive --
achieve results and which programs don't.
and this is important, not just for businesses and colleges, but for students and workers, as well.
if a parent is going to spend time in the classroom and away from his or her family -- especially after a long day at work -- that degree really has to mean something.
they have to know that when they get that degree, this is going to help advance their goals.
if a worker is going to spend two years training to enter into a whole new profession, that certificate has to mean that he or she is ready, and that businesses are ready to hire.
in addition, we want to propose new funding for innovative strategies that promote not just enrollment in a community college program, but completion of that program.
see, more than half -- more than half of all students who enter community college to earn an associate degree, or transfer to a four-year school to earn a bachelor's degree, unfortunately fail to reach their goal.
that's not just a waste of a valuable resource, that's a tragedy for these students.
oftentimes they've taken out debt and they don't get the degree, but they still have to pay back the debt.
and it's a disaster for our economy.
so we'll fund programs that track student progress inside and outside the classroom.
let's figure out what's keeping students from crossing that finish line, and then put in place reforms that will remove those barriers.
maybe it becomes too difficult for a parent to be away from home, or too expensive for a waiter or a nurse to miss a shift.
maybe a young student just isn't sure if her education will lead to employment.
the point is, we need to figure out solutions for these kinds of challenges -- because facing these impediments shouldn't prevent you from reaching your potential.
all right, so that's a big chunk of this first part of this initiative.
the second part:
we're going to back $10 billion in loans to renovate and rebuild college classrooms and buildings all across the country.
all too often, community colleges are treated like the stepchild of the higher education system; they're an afterthought, if they're thought of at all.
and that means schools are often years behind in the facilities they provide, which means, in a 21st century economy
, they're years behind in the education they can offer.
that's a mistake
and it's one that we'll help to correct.
through this fund, schools will have the chance to borrow at a more affordable rate to modernize facilities, and they'll be building on the funds in the recovery plan that are already helping to renovate schools, including community colleges all across the country.
and by the way, not only does this improve the schools and the training that they're providing, guess what?
you also have to hire some workers and some tradesmen and women to do the work on those schools.
so it means it's putting people to work in michigan right here right now.
number three:
even as we repair bricks and mortar, we have an opportunity to build a new virtual infrastructure to complement the education and training community colleges can offer.
so we're going to support the creation of a new online, open-source clearinghouse of courses so that community colleges across the country can offer more classes without building more classrooms.
and this will make a big difference especially for rural campuses that a lot of times have struggled --
attract -- have to struggle to attract students and faculty.
and this will make it possible for a professor to complement his lecture with an online exercise, or for a student who can't be away from her family to still keep up with her coursework.
we don't know where this kind of experiment will lead, but that's exactly why we ought to try it because i think there's a possibility that online education can provide especially for people who are already in the workforce and want to retrain the chance to upgrade their skills without having to quit their job.
so let me say this more:  the road to recovery, the road to prosperity, is going to be hard.
it was never going to be easy.
when i was sworn in, we were seeing 700 [thousand] jobs lost that month.
then we had the same amount lost for two more consecutive months.
now we've got an average of about 400,000 jobs lost -- but we're still losing too many jobs.
we will get to the point where we're not losing jobs, but then we've got to start getting to the point where we're actually creating jobs.
and it's going to take time.
there are going to be false starts
and there are going to be setbacks.
but i am confident that we can meet the challenges we face, because that's what we've always done.
that's what america does.
we hit some challenges, we fuss and argue about it, and then we go ahead and go about the business of solving our problems.
that's what we see on display right here at macomb community college.
that's what i've seen at colleges and universities all across this country.
at every juncture in our history when we've been challenged, we have summoned the resilience and the industriousness -- that can-do american spirit -- that has allowed us to succeed in the face of even the toughest odds.
that's what we can and must do now, not just
to overcome this crisis, but to leave something better behind, to lay a foundation on which our children and our grandchildren can prosper and take responsibility for their future -- just as the students at this school, at this difficult moment, are taking responsibility for theirs.
i am absolutely confident that if i've got your help, that we can make it happen, and we are going to see a stronger, more prosperous michigan in the years to come.
thank you very much, warren.
god bless you.
god bless the united states of america.
good morning, everybody.
before i introduce america's next surgeon general, i'd like to say a few words about our ongoing efforts to reform the health care system that she will help oversee.
we are now closer to the goal of health care reform than we have ever been.
over the last several weeks, key committees in the house and the senate have made important and unprecedented progress on a plan that will lower costs, provide better care for patients, and curb the worst practices of the insurance companies.
it's a plan that will not add to our deficit over the next decade.
let me repeat that:  it is a plan that will not add to our deficit over the next decade -- and eventually will help lower our deficit by slowing the skyrocketing cost of medicare and medicaid.
even though we are close, i've got no illusions that it's going to be easy to get over the finish line.
there are going to be more debates and more disagreements before all is said and done.
but health care reform must be done.
i know there are those who believe we should wait to solve this problem, or take a more incremental approach, or simply do nothing.
but this is the kind of criticism we heard when the country tried to pass medicare, a program that is now providing quality care to generations of american seniors.
it's the kind of criticism we heard when we tried to pass the children's health insurance program, which has provided quality care and coverage to millions of kids.
it's the same washington thinking that has ignored big challenges and put off tough decisions for decades.
and it is precisely that kind of small thinking that has led us into the current predicament.
so make no mistake:
the status quo on health care is no longer an option for the united states of america.
if we step back from this challenge right now, we will leave our children a legacy of debt -- a future of crushing costs that bankrupt our families, our businesses, and because we will have done nothing to bring down the cost of medicare and medicaid, will crush our government.
premiums will continue to skyrocket -- placing what amounts to another tax on american families struggling to pay bills.
the insurance companies and special interests that have killed reform in the past will only continue to benefit even more -- and they'll continue to deny coverage to americans with pre-existing medical conditions.
people will continue to lose health insurance just because they lose their job or they change jobs.
this is a future that we cannot afford.
this country can't afford to have health care premiums rise three times faster than people's wages, as they did over the last decade.
we can't afford 14,000 americans losing their health care every single day.
we can't afford a future where our government will eventually spend more on medicare and medicaid than what we spend on everything else.
and during the campaign, i promised health care reform that would control costs, expand coverage, and ensure choice.
and i promised that americans making $250,000 a year or less would not pay more in taxes.
these are promises that we're keeping as reform moves forward.
this is no longer a problem we can wait to fix.
this is about who we are as a country.
health care reform is about every family's health, but it's also about the health of the economy.
so i just want to put everybody on notice, because there was a lot of chatter during the week that i was gone:
we are going to get this done.
inaction is not an option.
and for those nay-sayers and cynics who think that this is not going to happen, don't bet against us.
we are going to make this thing happen, because the american people desperately need it.
and even those who are satisfied with their health care right now, they understand that if premiums keep on doubling and if employers keep on shedding health insurance because it's unsustainable and if you look at the trajectory of where medicare and medicaid are going, then inaction will create the biggest crisis of all.
and so i understand people are a little nervous and a little scared about making change.
the muscles in this town to bring about big changes are a little atrophied, but we're whipping folks back into shape.
we are going to get this done.
and if there's anyone who understands the urgency of meeting this challenge in a personal and powerful way, it's the woman who will become our nation's next surgeon general, dr. regina benjamin.
the list of qualifications that make dr. benjamin an outstanding candidate to be america's leading spokesperson on issues of public health are long indeed.
she was in the second class at morehouse school of medicine and went on to earn an md from the university of alabama at birmingham and an mba from tulane.
she served as associate dean for rural health at the university of south alabama college of medicine, and in 1995, she became the first physician under 40 and the first african american woman to be named to the american medical association's board of trustees.
in 2002, she became president of alabama's state medical association.
and she has received numerous awards and recognitions, including the macarthur genius award.
it's very impressive.
but of all these achievements and experience, none has been more pertinent to today's challenges or closer to regina's heart than the rural health clinic that she has built and rebuilt in bayou
la batre
-- did i say that right?
well, tell me how to say it.
dr. benjamin:
bayou
la batre.
the president:  bayou
la batre.
that's in alabama, people.
bayou
la batre is a rural town of about 2,500 people.
it's a shrimping town, where a lot of folks work for themselves, scrape by, and can't usually afford health insurance.
and by the way, dr. benjamin, while we were talking in the oval office, described for me the demographics of this town are actually very interesting, because you've got whites, blacks, and asians in this community.
there are a lot of laotians and cambodians who have moved there and are part of this shrimping town, so it's a diverse but very poor rural community.
and like so many other rural communities, doctors and hospitals are hard to come by.
and that's why, even though she could have left the state to make more money as a specialist or as a doctor in a wealthier community, regina benjamin returned to alabama and opened a small clinic in bayou la batre.
when people couldn't pay, she didn't charge them.
when the clinic wasn't making money, she didn't take a salary for herself.
when hurricane george destroyed the clinic in 1998, she made house calls to all her patients while it was rebuilt.
when hurricane katrina destroyed it again and left most of her town homeless, she mortgaged her house and maxed out her credit cards to rebuild that clinic for a second time.
she tended to those who had been wounded in the storm, and when folks needed medicine, she asked the pharmacist to send the bill her way.
and when regina's clinic was about to open for the third time, and a fire burned it to the ground before it could serve the first patient, well, you can guess what dr. benjamin did.
with help from her community, she is rebuilding it again.
one disabled patient brought her an envelope with $20 inside.
another elderly man said simply, "maybe i can help.
i got a hammer.
"
for nearly two decades, dr. regina benjamin has seen in a very personal way what is broken about our health care system.
she's seen an increasing number of patients who've had health insurance
their entire lives suddenly lose it because they lost their jobs or because it's simply become too expensive.
she's been a relentless promoter of prevention and wellness programs, having treated too many costly and -- diseases and complications that didn't have to happen.
and she's witnessed the shortage of primary care physicians in the rural and underserved areas where she works.
but for all that she's seen and all the tremendous obstacles that she has overcome, regina benjamin also represents what's best about health care in america -- doctors and nurses who give and care and sacrifice for the sake of their patients; those americans who would do anything to heal a fellow citizen.
through floods and fires and severe want, regina benjamin has refused to give up.
her patients have refused to give up.
and when we were talking in the oval office, she said:  the one thing i want to do is make sure that this surgeon general's office gives voice to patients, that patients have a seat at the table; somebody is advocating for them and speaking for them.
and now we in washington and across america have to refuse to give up on the goal of health care that is affordable and accessible for every last one of us.
we don't have to deal with hurricanes and we don't have to deal with floods
and we don't have to deal with fires; all we have to do is pass a bill to make sure that the american people have a decent shot at getting the kind of choice and high-quality health care that's affordable.
and i know that dr. benjamin is going to help us get there as the next surgeon general.
and i am truly honored to nominate her for that post, and secretary sebelius is equally excited, even though she's just standing here.
with that, let me introduce the next surgeon general of the united states, dr. regina benjamin.
good morning.
it is a great honor for me to join you at the new economic school.
michelle and i are so pleased to be in moscow.
and as somebody who was born in hawaii, i'm glad to be here in july instead of january.
i know that nes is a young school, but i speak to you today with deep respect for russia's timeless heritage.
russian writers have helped us understand the complexity of the human experience, and recognize eternal truths.
russian painters, composers, and dancers have introduced us to new forms of beauty.
russian scientists have cured disease, sought new frontiers of progress, and helped us go to space.
these are contributions that are not contained by russia's borders, as vast as those borders are.
indeed, russia's heritage has touched every corner of the world, and speaks to the humanity that we share.
that includes my own country, which has been blessed with russian immigrants for decades; we've been enriched by russian culture, and enhanced by russian cooperation.
and as a resident of washington, d.c., i continue to benefit from the contributions of russians -- specifically, from alexander ovechkin.
we're very pleased to have him in washington, d.c.
here at nes, you have inherited this great cultural legacy, but your focus on economics is no less fundamental to the future of humanity.
as pushkin said, "inspiration is needed in geometry just as much as poetry."
and today, i want particularly to speak to those of you preparing to graduate.
you're poised to be leaders in academia and industry; in finance and government.
but before you move forward, it's worth reflecting on what has already taken place during your young lives.
like president medvedev and myself, you're not old enough to have witnessed the darkest hours of the cold war, when hydrogen bombs were tested in the atmosphere, and children drilled in fallout shelters, and we reached the brink of nuclear catastrophe.
but you are the last generation born when the world was divided.
at that time, the american and soviet armies were still massed in europe, trained and ready to fight.
the ideological trenches of the last century were roughly in place.
competition in everything from astrophysics to athletics was treated as a zero-sum game.
if one person won, then the other person had to lose.
and then, within a few short years, the world as it was ceased to be.
now, make no mistake: this change did not come from any one nation.
the cold war reached a conclusion because of the actions of many nations over many years, and because the people of russia and eastern europe stood up and decided that its end would be peaceful.
with the end of the cold war, there were extraordinary expectations -- for peace and for prosperity; for new arrangements among nations, and new opportunities for individuals.
like all periods of great change, it was a time of ambitious plans and endless possibilities.
but, of course, things don't always work out exactly as planned.
back in 1993, shortly after this school opened, one nes student summed up the difficulty of change when he told a reporter, and i quote him: "the real world is not so rational as on paper."
the real world is not so rational as on paper.
over two tumultuous decades, that truth has been borne out around the world.
great wealth has been created, but it has not eliminated vast pockets of crushing poverty.
poverty exists here, it exists in the united states, and it exists all around the world.
more people have gone to the ballot box, but too many governments still fail to protect the rights of their people.
ideological struggles have diminished, but they've been replaced by conflicts over tribe and ethnicity and religion.
a human being with a computer can hold the same amount of information stored in the russian state library, but that technology can also be used to do great harm.
in a new russia, the disappearance of old political and economic restrictions after the end of the soviet union brought both opportunity and hardship.
a few prospered, but many more did not.
there were tough times.
but the russian people showed strength and made sacrifices, and you achieved hard-earned progress through a growing economy and greater confidence.
and despite painful times, many in eastern europe and russia are much better off today than 20 years ago.
we see that progress here at nes -- a school founded with western support that is now distinctly russian; a place of learning and inquiry where the test of an idea is not whether it is russian or american or european, but whether it works.
above all, we see that progress in all of you -- young people with a young century to shape as you see fit.
your lifetime coincides with this era of transition.
but think about the fundamental questions asked when this school was founded.
what kind of future is russia going to have?
what kind of future are russia and america going to have together?
what world order will replace the cold war?
those questions still don't have clear answers, and so now they must be answered by you -- by your generation in russia, in america, and around the world.
you get to decide.
and while i cannot answer those questions for you, i can speak plainly about the future that america is seeking.
to begin with, let me be clear: america wants a strong, peaceful, and prosperous russia.
this belief is rooted in our respect for the russian people, and a shared history between our nations that goes beyond competition.
despite our past rivalry, our people were allies in the greatest struggle of the last century.
recently, i noted this when i was in normandy -- for just as men from boston and birmingham risked all that they had to storm those beaches and scale those cliffs, soviet soldiers from places like kazan and kiev endured unimaginable hardships to repeal -- to repel an invasion, and turn the tide in the east.
as president john kennedy said, "no nation in history of battle ever suffered more than the soviet union in the second world war."
so as we honor this past, we also recognize the future benefit that will come from a strong and vibrant russia.
think of the issues that will define your lives: security from nuclear weapons and extremism; access to markets and opportunity; health and the environment; an international system that protects sovereignty and human rights, while promoting stability and prosperity.
these challenges demand global partnership, and that partnership will be stronger if russia occupies its rightful place as a great power.
yet unfortunately, there is sometimes a sense that old assumptions must prevail, old ways of thinking; a conception of power that is rooted in the past rather than in the future.
there is the 20th century view that the united states and russia are destined to be antagonists, and that a strong russia or a strong america can only assert themselves in opposition to one another.
and there is a 19th century view that we are destined to vie for spheres of influence, and that great powers must forge competing blocs to balance one another.
these assumptions are wrong.
in 2009, a great power does not show strength by dominating or demonizing other countries.
the days when empires could treat sovereign states as pieces on a chess board are over.
as i said in cairo, given our independence, any world order that -- given our interdependence, any world order that tries to elevate one nation or one group of people over another will inevitably fail.
the pursuit of power is no longer a zero-sum game -- progress must be shared.
that's why i have called for a "reset" in relations between the united states and russia.
this must be more than a fresh start between the kremlin and the white house -- though that is important and i've had excellent discussions with both your president and your prime minister.
it must be a sustained effort among the american and russian people to identify mutual interests, and expand dialogue and cooperation that can pave the way to progress.
this will not be easy.
it's difficult to forge a lasting partnership between former adversaries, it's hard to change habits that have been ingrained in our governments and our bureaucracies for decades.
but i believe that on the fundamental issues that will shape this century, americans and russians share common interests that form a basis for cooperation.
it is not for me to define russia's national interests, but i can tell you about america's national interests, and i believe that you will see that we share common ground.
first, america has an interest in reversing the spread of nuclear weapons and preventing their use.
in the last century, generations of americans and russians inherited the power to destroy nations, and the understanding that using that power would bring about our own destruction.
in 2009, our inheritance is different.
you and i don't have to ask whether american and russian leaders will respect a balance of terror -- we understand the horrific consequences of any war between our two countries.
but we do have to ask this question: we have to ask whether extremists who have killed innocent civilians in new york and in moscow will show that same restraint.
we have to ask whether 10 or 20 or 50 nuclear-armed nations will protect their arsenals and refrain from using them.
this is the core of the nuclear challenge in the 21st century.
the notion that prestige comes from holding these weapons, or that we can protect ourselves by picking and choosing which nations can have these weapons, is an illusion.
in the short period since the end of the cold war, we've already seen india, pakistan, and north korea conduct nuclear tests.
without a fundamental change, do any of us truly believe that the next two decades will not bring about the further spread of these nuclear weapons?
that's why america is committed to stopping nuclear proliferation, and ultimately seeking a world without nuclear weapons.
that is consistent with our commitment under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.
that is our responsibility as the world's two leading nuclear powers.
and while i know this goal won't be met soon, pursuing it provides the legal and moral foundation to prevent the proliferation and eventual use of nuclear weapons.
we're already taking important steps to build this foundation.
yesterday, president medvedev and i made progress on negotiating a new treaty that will substantially reduce our warheads and delivery systems.
we renewed our commitment to clean, safe and peaceful nuclear energy, which must be a right for all nations that live up to their responsibilities under the npt.
and we agreed to increase cooperation on nuclear security, which is essential to achieving the goal of securing all vulnerable nuclear material within four years.
as we keep our own commitments, we must hold other nations accountable for theirs.
whether america or russia, neither of us would benefit from a nuclear arms race in east asia or the middle east.
that's why we should be united in opposing north korea's efforts to become a nuclear power, and opposing iran's efforts to acquire a nuclear weapon.
and i'm pleased that president medvedev and
i agreed upon a joint threat assessment of the ballistic challenges -- ballistic missile challenges of the 21st century, including from iran and north korea.
this is not about singling out individual nations -- it's about the responsibilities of all nations.
if we fail to stand together, then the npt and the security council will lose credibility, and international law will give way to the law of the jungle.
and that benefits no one.
as i said in prague, rules must be binding, violations must be punished, and words must mean something.
the successful enforcement of these rules will remove causes of disagreement.
i know russia opposes the planned configuration for missile defense in europe.
and my administration is reviewing these plans to enhance the security of america, europe and the world.
and i've made it clear that this system is directed at preventing a potential attack from iran.
it has nothing to do with russia.
in fact, i want to work together with russia on a missile defense architecture that makes us all safer.
but if the threat from iran's nuclear and ballistic missile program is eliminated, the driving force for missile defense in europe will be eliminated, and that is in our mutual interests.
now, in addition to securing the world's most dangerous weapons, a second area where america has a critical national interest is in isolating and defeating violent extremists.
for years, al qaeda and its affiliates have defiled a great religion of peace and justice, and ruthlessly murdered men, women and children of all nationalities and faiths.
indeed, above all, they have murdered muslims.
and these extremists have killed in amman and bali; islamabad and kabul; and they have the blood of americans and russians on their hands.
they're plotting to kill more of our people, and they benefit from safe havens that allow them to train and operate -- particularly along the border of pakistan and afghanistan.
and that's why america has a clear goal: to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al qaeda and its allies in afghanistan and pakistan.
we seek no bases, nor do we want to control these nations.
instead, we want to work with international partners, including russia, to help afghans and pakistanis advance their own security and prosperity.
and that's why i'm pleased that russia has agreed to allow the united states to supply our coalition forces through your territory.
neither america nor russia has an interest in an afghanistan or pakistan governed by the taliban.
it's time to work together on behalf of a different future -- a future in which we leave behind the great game of the past and the conflict of the present; a future in which all of us contribute to the security of central asia.
now, beyond afghanistan, america is committed to promoting the opportunity that will isolate extremists.
we are helping the iraqi people build a better future, and leaving iraq to the iraqis.
we're pursuing the goal of two states, israel and palestine, living in peace and security.
we're partnering with muslim communities around the world to advance education, health, and economic development.
in each of these endeavors, i believe that the russian people share our goals, and will benefit from success -- and we need to partner together.
now, in addition to these security concerns, the third area that i will discuss is america's interest in global prosperity.
and since we have so many economists and future businessmen and women in the room, i know this is of great interest to you.
we meet in the midst of the worst global recession in a generation.
i believe that the free market is the greatest force for creating and distributing wealth that the world has known.
but wherever the market is allowed to run rampant -- through excessive risk-taking, a lack of regulation, or corruption
-- then all are endangered, whether we live on the mississippi or on the volga.
in america, we're now taking unprecedented steps to jumpstart our economy and reform our system of regulation.
but just as no nation can wall itself off from the consequences of a global crisis, no one can serve as the sole engine of global growth.
you see, during your lives, something fundamental has changed.
and while this crisis has shown us the risks that come with change, that risk is overwhelmed by opportunity.
think of what's possible today that was unthinkable two decades ago.
a young woman with an internet connection in bangalore, india can compete with anybody anywhere in the world.
an entrepreneur with a start-up company in beijing can take his business global.
an nes professor in moscow can collaborate with colleagues at harvard or stanford.
that's good for all of us, because when prosperity is created in india, that's a new market for our goods; when new ideas take hold in china, that pushes our businesses to innovate; when new connections are forged among people, all of us are enriched.
there is extraordinary potential for increased cooperation between americans and russians.
we can pursue trade that is free and fair and integrated with the wider world.
we can boost investment that creates jobs in both our countries, we can forge partnerships on energy that tap not only traditional resources, like oil and gas, but new sources of energy that will drive growth and combat climate change.
all of that, americans and russians can do together.
now, government can promote this cooperation, but ultimately individuals must advance this cooperation, because the greatest resource of any nation in the 21st century is you.
it's people; it's young people especially.
and the country which taps that resource will be the country that will succeed.
that success depends upon economies that function within the rule of law.
as president medvedev has rightly said, a mature and effective legal system is a condition for sustained economic development.
people everywhere should have the right to do business or get an education without paying a bribe.
whether they are in america or russia or africa or latin america, that's not a american idea or a russian idea -- that's how people and countries will succeed in the 21st century.
and this brings me to the fourth issue that i will discuss -- america's interest in democratic governments that protect the rights of their people.
by no means is america perfect.
but it is our commitment to certain universal values which allows us to correct our imperfections, to improve constantly, and to grow stronger over time.
freedom of speech and assembly has allowed women, and minorities, and workers to protest for full and equal rights at a time when they were denied.
the rule of law and equal administration of justice has busted monopolies, shut down political machines that were corrupt, ended abuses of power.
independent media have exposed corruption at all levels of business and government.
competitive elections allow us to change course and hold our leaders accountable.
if our democracy did not advance those rights, then i, as a person of african ancestry, wouldn't be able to address you as an american citizen, much less a president.
because at the time of our founding, i had no rights -- people who looked like me.
but it is because of that process that i can now stand before you as president of the united states.
so around the world, america supports these values because they are moral, but also because they work.
the arc of history shows that governments which serve their own people survive and thrive; governments which serve only their own power do not.
governments that represent the will of their people are far less likely to descend into failed states, to terrorize their citizens, or to wage war on others.
governments that promote the rule of law, subject their actions to oversight, and allow for independent institutions are more dependable trading partners.
and in our own history, democracies have been america's most enduring allies, including those we once waged war with in europe and asia -- nations that today live with great security and prosperity.
now let me be clear: america cannot and should not seek to impose any system of government on any other country, nor would we presume to choose which party or individual should run a country.
and we haven't always done what we should have on that front.
even as we meet here today, america supports now the restoration of the democratically-elected president of honduras, even though he has strongly opposed american policies.
we do so not because we agree with him.
we do so because we respect the universal principle that people should choose their own leaders, whether they are leaders we agree with or not.
and that leads me to the final area that i will discuss, which is america's interest in an international system that advances cooperation while respecting the sovereignty of all nations.
state sovereignty must be a cornerstone of international order.
just as all states should have the right to choose their leaders, states must have the right to borders that are secure, and to their own foreign policies.
that is true for russia, just as it is true for the united states.
any system that cedes those rights will lead to anarchy.
that's why we must apply this principle to all nations -- and that includes nations like georgia and ukraine.
america will never impose a security arrangement on another country.
for any country to become a member of an organization like nato, for example, a majority of its people must choose to; they must undertake reforms; they must be able to contribute to the alliance's mission.
and let me be clear: nato should be seeking collaboration with russia, not confrontation.
and more broadly, we need to foster cooperation and respect among all nations and peoples.
as president of the united states, i will work tirelessly to protect america's security and to advance our interests.
but no one nation can meet the challenges of the 21st century on its own, nor dictate its terms to the world.
that is something that america now understands, just as russia understands.
that's why america seeks an international system that lets nations pursue their interests peacefully, especially when those interests diverge; a system where the universal rights of human beings are respected, and violations of those rights are opposed; a system where we hold ourselves to the same standards that we apply to other nations, with clear rights and responsibilities for all.
there was a time when roosevelt, churchill, and stalin could shape the world in one meeting.
those days are over.
the world is more complex today.
billions of people have found their voice, and seek their own measure of prosperity and self-determination in every corner of the planet.
over the past two decades, we've witnessed markets grow, wealth spread, and technology used to build -- not destroy.
we've seen old hatreds pass, illusions of differences between people lift and fade away; we've seen the human destiny in the hands of more and more human beings who can shape their own destinies.
now, we must see that the period of transition which you have lived through ushers in a new era in which nations live in peace, and people realize their aspirations for dignity, security, and a better life for their children.
that is america's interest, and i believe that it is russia's interest as well.
i know that this future can seem distant.
change is hard.
in the words of that nes student back in 1993, the real world is not so rational as on paper.
but think of the change that has unfolded with the passing of time.
one hundred years ago, a czar ruled russia, and europe was a place of empire.
when i was born, segregation was still the law of the land in parts of america, and my father's kenya was still a colony.
when you were born, a school like this would have been impossible, and the internet was only known to a privileged few.
you get to decide what comes next.
you get to choose where change will take us, because the future does not belong to those who gather armies on a field of battle or bury missiles in the ground; the future belongs to young people with an education and the imagination to create.
that is the source of power in this century.
and given all that has happened in your two decades on earth, just imagine what you can create in the years to come.
every country charts its own course.
russia has cut its way through time like a mighty river through a canyon, leaving an indelible mark on human history as it goes.
as you move this story forward, look to the future that can be built if we refuse to be burdened by the old obstacles and old suspicions; look to the future that can be built if we partner on behalf of the aspirations we hold in common.
together, we can build a world where people are protected, prosperity is enlarged, and our power truly serves progress.
and it is all in your hands.
good luck to all of you.
thank you very much.
good afternoon, everybody.
today i want to start by addressing three issues, and then i'll take your questions.
first, i'd like to say a few words about the situation in iran.
the united states and the international community have been appalled and outraged by the threats, the beatings, and imprisonments of the last few days.
i strongly condemn these unjust actions, and i join with the american people in mourning each and every innocent life that is lost.
i've made it clear that the united states respects the sovereignty of the islamic republic of iran, and is not interfering with iran's affairs.
but we must also bear witness to the courage and the dignity of the iranian people, and to a remarkable opening within iranian society.
and we deplore the violence against innocent civilians anywhere that it takes place.
the iranian people are trying to have a debate about their future.
some in iran -- some in the iranian government, in particular, are trying to avoid that debate by accusing the united states and others in the west of instigating protests over the election.
these accusations are patently false.
they're an obvious attempt to distract people from what is truly taking place within iran's borders.
this tired strategy of using old tensions to scapegoat other countries won't work anymore in iran.
this is not about the united states or the west; this is about the people of iran, and the future that they -- and only they -- will choose.
the iranian people can speak for themselves.
that's precisely what's happened in the last few days.
in 2009, no iron fist is strong enough to shut off the world from bearing witness to peaceful protests of justice.
despite the iranian government's efforts to expel journalists and isolate itself, powerful images and poignant words have made their way to us through cell phones and computers, and so we've watched what the iranian people are doing.
this is what we've witnessed.
we've seen the timeless dignity of tens of thousands of iranians marching in silence.
we've seen people of all ages risk everything to insist that their votes are counted and that their voices are heard.
above all, we've seen courageous women stand up to the brutality and threats, and we've experienced the searing image of a woman bleeding to death on the streets.
while this loss is raw and extraordinarily painful, we also know this: those who stand up for justice are always on the right side of history.
as i said in cairo, suppressing ideas never succeeds in making them go away.
the iranian people have a universal right to assembly and free speech.
if the iranian government seeks the respect of the international community, it must respect those rights and heed the will of its own people.
it must govern through consent and not coercion.
that's what iran's own people are calling for, and the iranian people will ultimately judge the actions of their own government.
thank you so much.
please, everybody, be seated.
thank you very much.
you're very kind.
thank you.
let me begin by thanking nancy for the wonderful introduction.
i want to thank dr. joseph heyman, the chair of the board of trustees, as well as dr. jeremy lazarus, speaker of house of delegates.
thanks to all of you for bringing me home, even if it's just for a day.
from the moment i took office as president, the central challenge we've confronted as a nation has been the need to lift ourselves out of the worst recession since world war ii.
in recent months, we've taken a series of extraordinary steps, not just to repair the immediate damage to our economy, but to build a new foundation for lasting and sustained growth.
we're here to create new jobs, to unfreeze our credit markets.
we're stemming the loss of homes and the decline of home values.
all this is important.
but even as we've made progress, we know that the road to prosperity remains long and it remains difficult.
and we also know that one essential step on our journey is to control the spiraling cost of health care in america.
and in order to do that, we're going to need the help of the ama.
today, we are spending over $2 trillion a year on health care -- almost 50 percent more per person than the next most costly nation.
and yet, as i think many of you are aware, for all of this spending, more of our citizens are uninsured, the quality of our care is often lower, and we aren't any healthier.
in fact, citizens in some countries that spend substantially less than we do are actually living longer than we do.
make no mistake: the cost of our health care is a threat to our economy.
it's an escalating burden on our families and businesses.
it's a ticking time bomb for the federal budget.
and it is unsustainable for the united states of america.
it's unsustainable for americans like laura klitzka, a young mother that i met in wisconsin just last week, who's learned that the breast cancer she thought she'd beaten had spread to her bones, but who's now being forced to spend time worrying about how to cover the $50,000 in medical debts she's already accumulated, worried about future debts that she's going to accumulate, when all she wants to do is spend time with her two children and focus on getting well.
these are not the worries that a woman like laura should have to face in a nation as wealthy as ours.
stories like laura's are being told by women and men all across this country -- by families who've seen out-of-pocket costs soar, and premiums double over the last decade at a rate three times faster than wages.
this is forcing americans of all ages to go without the checkups or the prescriptions they need -- that you know they need.
it's creating a situation where a single illness can wipe out a lifetime of savings.
our costly health care system is unsustainable for doctors like michael kahn in new hampshire, who, as he puts it, spends 20 percent of each day supervising a staff explaining insurance problems to patients, completing authorization forms, writing appeal letters -- a routine that he calls disruptive and distracting, giving him less time to do what he became a doctor to do and actually care for his patients.
small business owners like chris and becky link in nashville are also struggling.
they've always wanted to do right by the workers at their family-run marketing firm, but they've recently had to do the unthinkable and lay off a number of employees -- layoffs that could have been deferred, they say, if health care costs weren't so high.
across the country, over one-third of small businesses have reduced benefits in recent years and one-third have dropped their workers' coverage altogether since the early '90s.
our largest companies are suffering, as well.
a big part of what led general motors and chrysler into trouble in recent decades were the huge costs they racked up providing health care for their workers -- costs that made them less profitable and less competitive with automakers around the world.
if we do not fix our health care system, america may go the way of gm -- paying more, getting less, and going broke.
when it comes to the cost of our health care, then, the status quo is unsustainable.
so reform is not a luxury; it is a necessity.
when i hear people say, well, why are you taking this on right now
, you've got all these other problems, i keep on reminding people
i'd love to be able to defer these issues, but we can't.
i know there's been much discussion about what reform would cost, and rightly so.
this is a test of whether we -- democrats and republicans alike -- are serious about holding the line on new spending and restoring fiscal discipline.
but let there be no doubt -- the cost of inaction is greater.
if we fail to act -- if we fail to act -- and you know this because you see it in your own individual practices -- if we fail to act, premiums will climb higher, benefits will erode further, the rolls of the uninsured will swell to include millions more americans -- all of which will affect your practice.
if we fail to act, one out of every five dollars we earn will be spent on health care within a decade.
and in 30 years, it will be about one out of every three -- a trend that will mean
lost jobs, lower take-home pay, shuttered businesses, and a lower standard of living for all americans.
and if we fail to act, federal spending on medicaid and medicare will grow over the coming decades by an amount almost equal to the amount our government currently spends on our nation's defense.
it will, in fact, eventually grow larger than what our government spends on anything else today.
it's a scenario that will swamp our federal and state budgets, and impose a vicious choice of either unprecedented tax hikes, or overwhelming deficits, or drastic cuts in our federal and state budgets.
so to say it as plainly as i can, health care is the single most important thing we can do for america's long-term fiscal health.
that is a fact.
that's a fact.
it's a fact, and the truth is most people know that it's a fact.
and yet, as clear as it is that our system badly needs reform, reform is not inevitable.
there's a sense out there among some, and perhaps some members who are gathered here today of the ama, that as bad as our current system may be -- and it's pretty bad --
the devil we know is better than the devil we don't.
there's a fear of change -- a worry that we may lose what works about our health care system while trying to fix what doesn't.
i'm here to tell you i understand that fear.
and i understand the cynicism.
they're scars left over from past efforts at reform.
after all, presidents have called for health care reform for nearly a century.
teddy roosevelt called for it.
harry truman called for it.
richard nixon called for it.
jimmy carter called for it.
bill clinton called for it.
but while significant individual reforms have been made -- such as medicare, medicaid, and the children's health insurance program -- efforts at comprehensive reform that covers everyone and brings down costs have largely failed.
part of the reason is because the different groups involved -- doctors, insurance companies, businesses, workers, and others -- simply couldn't agree on the need for reform or what shape it would take.
and if we're honest, another part of the reason has been the fierce opposition fueled by some interest groups and lobbyists -- opposition that has used fear tactics to paint any effort to achieve reform as an attempt to, yes, socialize medicine.
and despite this long history of failure, i'm standing here because i think we're in a different time.
one sign that things are different is that just this past week, the senate passed a bill that will protect children from the dangers of smoking, a reform the ama has long championed -- this organization long championed; it went nowhere when it was proposed a decade ago -- i'm going to sign this into law.
now, what makes this moment different is that this time -- for the first time -- key stakeholders are aligning not against, but in favor of reform.
they're coming out -- they're coming together out of a recognition that while reform will take everyone in our health care community to do their part -- everybody is going to have to pitch in -- ultimately, everybody will benefit.
and i want to commend the ama, in particular, for offering to do your part to curb costs and achieve reform.
just a week ago, you joined together with hospitals, labor unions, insurers, medical device manufacturers and drug companies to do something that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago -- you promised to work together to cut national health care spending by $2 trillion over the next decade, relative to what it would have otherwise been.
and that will bring down costs; that will bring down premiums.
that's exactly the kind of cooperation we need, and we appreciate that very much.
thank you.
now, the question is how do we finish the job?
how do we permanently bring down costs and make quality, affordable health care available to every single american?
that's what i've come to talk about today.
we know the moment is right for health care reform.
we know this is a historic opportunity we've never seen before and may not see again.
but we also know that there are those who will try and scuttle this opportunity no matter what -- who will use the same scare tactics and fear-mongering that's worked in the past; who will give warnings about socialized medicine and government takeovers, long lines and rationed care, decisions made by bureaucrats and not doctors.
we have heard this all before.
and because these fear tactics have worked, things have kept getting worse.
so let me begin by saying this to you and to the american people
: i know that there are millions of americans who are content with their health care coverage -- they like their plan and, most importantly, they value their relationship with their doctor.
they trust you.
and that means that no matter how we reform health care, we will keep this promise to the american people: if you like your doctor, you will be able to keep your doctor, period.
if you like your health care plan, you'll be able to keep your health care plan, period.
no one will take it away, no matter what.
my view is that health care reform should be guided by a simple principle: fix what's broken and build on what works.
and that's what we intend to do.
if we do that, we can build a health care system that allows you to be physicians instead of administrators and accountants; a system that gives americans -- a system that gives americans the best care at the lowest cost; a system that eases up the pressure on businesses and unleashes the promise of our economy, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs, making take-home wages thousands of dollars higher, and growing our economy by tens of billions of dollars more every year.
that's how we'll stop spending tax dollars to prop up an unsustainable system, and start investing those dollars in innovations and advances that will make our health care system and our economy stronger.
that's what we can do with this opportunity.
and that's what we must do with this moment.
now, the good news is that in some instances, there's already widespread agreement on the steps necessary to make our health care system work better.
first, we need to upgrade our medical records by switching from a paper to an electronic system of record keeping.
and we've already begun to do this with an investment we made as part of our recovery act.
it simply doesn't make sense that patients in the 21st century are still filling out forms with pens on papers that have to be stored away somewhere.
as newt gingrich has rightly pointed out -- and i don't quote newt gingrich that often -- we do a better job tracking a fedex package in this country than we do tracking patients' health records.
you shouldn't have to tell every new doctor you see about your medical history or
what prescriptions you're taking.
you shouldn't have to repeat costly tests.
all that information should be stored securely in a private medical record so that your information can be tracked from one doctor to another -- even if you change jobs, even if you move, even if you have to see a number of different specialists.
that's just common sense.
and that will not only mean less paper-pushing and lower administrative costs, saving taxpayers billions of dollars; it will also mean all of you physicians will have an easier time doing your jobs.
it will tell you, the doctors, what drugs a patient is taking so you can avoid prescribing a medication that could cause a harmful interaction.
it will prevent the wrong dosages from going to a patient.
it will reduce medical errors, it's estimated, that lead to 100,000 lives lost unnecessarily in our hospitals every year.
so there shouldn't be an argument there.
and we want to make sure that we're helping providers computerize so that we can get this system up and running.
the second step that we can all agree on is to invest more in preventive care so we can avoid illness and disease in the first place.
that starts with each of us taking more responsibility for our health and for the health of our children.
it means quitting smoking.
it means going in for that mammogram or colon cancer screening.
it means going for a run or hitting the gym, and raising our children to step away from the video games and spend more time playing outside.
it also means cutting down on all the junk food that's fueling an epidemic of obesity -- which puts far too many americans, young and old, at greater risk of costly, chronic conditions.
that's a lesson michelle
and i have tried to instill in our daughters.
as some of you know, we started a white house vegetable garden.
i say "
we" generously, because michelle has done most of the work.
that's a lesson that we should work with local school districts to incorporate into their school lunch programs.
building a health care system that promotes prevention rather than just managing diseases will require all of us to do our parts.
it will take doctors telling us what risk factors we should avoid and what preventive measures we should pursue.
it will take employers following the example of places like safeway that is rewarding workers for taking better care of their health while reducing health care costs in the process.
if you're one of three-quarters of safeway workers enrolled in their "healthy measures" program, you can get screened for problems like high cholesterol or high blood pressure.
and if you score well, you can pay lower premiums; you get more money in your paycheck.
it's a program that has helped safeway cut health care spending by 13 percent, and workers save over 20 percent on their premiums.
and we're open to doing more to help employers adopt and expand programs like this one.
our federal government also has to step up its efforts to advance the cause of healthy living.
five of the costliest illnesses and conditions -- cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, lung disease, and strokes -- can be prevented.
and yet only a fraction of every health care dollar goes to prevention or public health.
and that's starting to change with an investment we're making in prevention and wellness programs that can help us avoid disease that harm our health and the health of our economy.
but as important as they are, investments in electronic records and preventive care, all the things that i've just mentioned, they're just preliminary steps.
they will only make a dent in the epidemic of rising costs in this country.
despite what some have suggested, the reason we have these spiraling costs is not simply because we've got an aging population; demographics do account for part of rising costs because older, sicker societies pay more on health care than younger, healthier ones, and there's nothing intrinsically wrong in us taking better care of ourselves.
but what accounts for the bulk of our costs is the nature of our health care delivery system itself -- a system where we spend vast amounts of money on things that aren't necessarily making our people any healthier; a system that automatically equates more expensive care with better care.
now, a recent article in the new yorker, for example, showed how mcallen, texas, is spending twice as much as el paso county -- twice as much -- not because people in mcallen, texas, are sicker than they are in el paso; not because they're getting better care or getting better outcomes.
it's simply because they're using more treatments -- treatments that, in some cases, they don't really need; treatments that, in some cases, can actually do people harm by raising the risk of infection or medical error.
and the problem is this pattern is repeating itself across america.
one dartmouth study shows that you're less likely --
you're no less likely to die from a heart attack and other ailments in a higher-spending area than in a lower-spending one.
there are two main reasons for this.
the first is a system of incentives where the more tests and services are provided, the more money we pay.
and a lot of people in this room know what i'm talking about.
it's a model that rewards the quantity of care rather than the quality of care; that pushes you, the doctor, to see more and more patients even if you can't spend much time with each, and gives you every incentive to order that extra mri or ekg, even if it's not necessary.
it's a model that has taken the pursuit of medicine from a profession -- a calling -- to a business.
that's not why you became doctors.
that's not why you put in all those hours in the anatomy suite or the o.r
.
that's not what brings you back to a patient's bedside to check in, or
makes you call a loved one of a patient to say it will be fine.
you didn't enter this profession to be bean-counters and paper-pushers.
you entered this profession to be healers.
and that's what our health care system should let you be.
that's what this health care system should let you be.
now, that starts with reforming the way we compensate our providers -- doctors and hospitals.
we need to bundle payments so you aren't paid for every single treatment you offer a patient with a chronic condition like diabetes, but instead paid well for how you treat the overall disease.
we need to create incentives for physicians to team up, because we know that when that happens, it results in a healthier patient.
we need to give doctors bonuses for good health outcomes, so we're not promoting just more treatment, but better care.
and we need to rethink the cost of a medical education, and do more to reward medical students who choose a career as a primary care physician -- who choose to work in underserved areas instead of the more lucrative paths.
that's why we're making a substantial investment in the national health service corps that will make medical training more affordable for primary care doctors and nurse practitioners so they aren't drowning in debt when they enter the workforce.
somebody back there is drowning in debt.
the second structural reform we need to make is to improve the quality of medical information making its way to doctors and patients.
we have the best medical schools, the most sophisticated labs, the most advanced training of any nation on the globe.
yet we're not doing a very good job harnessing our collective knowledge and experience on behalf of better medicine.
less than 1 percent of our health care spending goes to examining what treatments are most effective -- less than 1 percent.
and even when that information finds its way into journals, it can take up to 17 years to find its way to an exam room or operating table.
as a result, too many doctors and patients are making decisions without the benefit of the latest research.
a recent study, for example, found that only half of all cardiac guidelines are based on scientific evidence -- half.
that means doctors may be doing a bypass operation when placing a stent is equally effective; or placing a stent when adjusting a patient's drug and medical management is equally effective -- all of which drives up costs without improving a patient's health.
so one thing we need to do is to figure out what works, and encourage rapid implementation of what works into your practices.
that's why we're making a major investment in research to identify the best treatments for a variety of ailments and conditions.
now, let me be clear -- i just want to clear something up here -- identifying what works is not about dictating what kind of care should be provided.
it's about providing patients and doctors with the information they need to make the best medical decisions.
see, i have the assumption that if you have good information about what makes your patients well, that's what you're going to do.
i have confidence in that.
we're not going to need to force you to do it.
we just need to make sure you've got the best information available.
still, even when we do know what works, we are often not making the most of it.
and that's why we need to build on the examples of outstanding medicine at places like the cincinnati children's hospital, where the quality of care for cystic fibrosis patients shot up after the hospital began incorporating suggestions from parents.
and places like tallahassee memorial health care, where deaths were dramatically reduced with rapid response teams that monitored patients' conditions, and "multidisciplinary rounds" with everyone from physicians to pharmacists.
and places like geisinger health system in rural pennsylvania, and intermountain health in salt lake city, where high-quality care is being provided at a cost well below the national average.
these are all islands of excellence that we need to make the standard in our health care system.
so replicating best practices, incentivizing excellence, closing cost disparities -- any legislation sent to my desk that does not these -- does not achieve these goals in my mind does not earn the title of reform.
but my signature on a bill is not enough.
i need your help, doctors, because to most americans you are the health care system.
the fact is americans -- and i include myself and michelle and our kids in this
-- we just do what you tell us to do.
that's what we do.
we listen to you, we trust you.
and that's why i will listen to you and work with you to pursue reform that works for you.
together, if we take all these steps, i am convinced we can bring spending down, bring quality up; we can save hundreds of billions of dollars on health care costs while making our health care system work better for patients and doctors alike.
and when we align the interests of patients and doctors, then we're going to be in a good place.
now, i recognize that it will be hard to make some of these changes if doctors feel like they're constantly looking over their shoulders for fear of lawsuits.
i recognize that.
don't get too excited yet.
now, i understand some doctors may feel the need to order more tests and treatments to avoid being legally vulnerable.
that's a real issue.
now, just hold on to your horses here, guys.
i want to be honest with you.
i'm not advocating caps on malpractice awards -- which i personally believe can be unfair to people who've been wrongfully harmed.
but i do think we need to explore a range of ideas about how to put patient safety first
; how to let doctors focus on practicing medicine; how to encourage broader use of evidence-based guidelines.
i want to work with the ama
so we can scale back the excessive defensive medicine that reinforces our current system, and shift to a system where we are providing better care, simply -- rather than simply more treatment.
so this is going to be a priority for me.
and i know, based on your responses, it's a priority for you.
and i look forward to working with you.
and it's going to be difficult.
but all this stuff is going to be difficult.
all of it's going to be important.
now, i know this has been a long speech, but we got more to do.
the changes that i have already spoken about, all that is going to need to go hand-in-hand with other reforms.
because our health care system is so complex and medicine is always evolving,
we need a way to continually evaluate how we can eliminate waste, reduce costs, and improve quality.
that's why i'm open to expanding the role of a commission created by a republican congress called the medicare payment advisory commission, which happens to include a number of physicians on the commission.
in recent years, this commission proposed roughly $200 billion in savings that never made it into law.
these recommendations have now been incorporated into our broader reform agenda, but we need to fast-track their proposals, the commission's proposals, in the future so that we don't miss another opportunity to save billions of dollars, as we gain more information about what works and what doesn't work in our health care system.
and as we seek to contain the cost of health care, we also have to ensure that every american can get coverage they can afford.
we must do so in part because it's in all of our economic interests.
each time an uninsured american steps foot into an emergency room with no way to reimburse the hospital for care, the cost is handed over to every american family as a bill of about $1,000 that's reflected in higher taxes, higher premiums, and higher health care costs.
it's a hidden tax, a hidden bill that will be cut as we insure all americans.
and as we insure every young and healthy american, it will spread out risk for insurance companies, further reducing costs for everyone.
but alongside these economic arguments, there's another, more powerful one.
and it is simply this: we are not a nation that accepts nearly 46 million uninsured men, women and children.
we are not a nation that lets hardworking families go without coverage, or turns its back on those in need.
we're a nation that cares for its citizens.
we look out for one another.
that's what makes us the united states of america.
we need to get this done.
so we need to do a few things to provide affordable health insurance to every single american.
the first thing we need to do is to protect what's working in our health care system.
so just in case you didn't catch it the first time, let me repeat: if you like your health care system and your doctor, the only thing reform will mean to you
is your health care will cost less.
if anyone says otherwise, they are either trying to mislead you or don't have their facts straight.
now, if you don't like your health care coverage or you don't have any insurance at all, you'll have a chance, under what we've proposed, to take part in what we're calling a health insurance exchange.
this exchange will allow you to one-stop shop for a health care plan, compare benefits and prices, and choose a plan that's best for you and your family -- the same way, by the way, that federal employees can do, from a postal worker to a member of congress.
you will have your choice of a number of plans that offer a few different packages, but every plan would offer an affordable, basic package.
again, this is for people who aren't happy with their current plan.
if you like what you're getting, keep it.
nobody is forcing you to shift.
but if you're not, this gives you some new options.
and i believe one of these options needs to be a public option that will give people a broader range of choices -- and inject competition into the health care market so that force -- so that we can force waste out of the system and keep the insurance companies honest.
now, i know that there's some concern about a public option.
even within this organization there's healthy debate about it.
in particular, i understand that you're concerned that today's medicare rates, which many of you already feel are too low, will be applied broadly in a way that means our cost savings are coming off your backs.
and these are legitimate concerns, but they're ones, i believe, that can be overcome.
as i stated earlier, the reforms we propose to reimbursement are to reward best practices, focus on patient care, not on the current piecework reimbursements.
what we seek is more stability and a health care system that's on a sounder financial footing.
and the fact is these reforms need to take place regardless of whether there's a public option or not.
with reform, we will ensure that you are being reimbursed in a thoughtful way that's tied to patient outcomes, instead of relying on yearly negotiations about the sustainable growth rate formula that's based on politics and the immediate state of the federal budget in any given year.
and i just want to point out the alternative to such reform
is a world where health care costs grow at an unsustainable rate.
and if you don't think that's going to threaten your reimbursements and the stability of our health care system, you haven't been paying attention.
so the public option is not your enemy; it is your friend, i believe.
let me also say that -- let me also address a illegitimate concern that's being put forward by those who are claiming that a public option is somehow a trojan horse for a single-payer system.
i'll be honest; there are countries where a single-payer system works pretty well.
but i believe --
and i've taken some flak from members of my own party for this belief --
that it's important for our reform efforts to build on our traditions here in the united states.
so when you hear the naysayers claim that i'm trying to bring about government-run health care, know this: they're not telling the truth.
what i am trying to do -- and what a public option will help do -- is put affordable health care within reach for millions of americans.
and to help ensure that everyone can afford the cost of a health care option in our exchange, we need to provide assistance to families who need it.
that way, there will be no reason at all for anyone to remain uninsured.
indeed, it's because i'm confident in our ability to give people the ability to get insurance at an affordable rate that i'm open to a system
where every american bears responsibility for owning health insurance -- so long as we provide a hardship waiver for those who still can't afford it as we move towards this system.
the same is true for employers.
while i believe every business has a responsibility to provide health insurance for its workers, small businesses that can't afford it should receive an exemption.
and small business workers and their families will be able to seek coverage in the exchange if their employer is not able to provide it.
now, here's some good news.
insurance companies have expressed support for the idea of covering the uninsured and they certainly are in favor of a mandate.
i welcome their willingness to engage constructively in the reform debate.
i'm glad they're at the table.
but what i refuse to do is simply create a system where insurance companies suddenly have a whole bunch of more customers on uncle sam's dime, but still fail to meet their responsibilities.
we're not going to do that.
let me give you an example of what i'm talking about.
we need to end the practice of denying coverage on the basis of preexisting conditions.
the days of cherry-picking who to cover and who to deny, those days are over.
i know you see it in your practices, and how incredibly painful and frustrating it is --
you want to give somebody care
and you find out that the insurance companies are wiggling out of paying.
this is personal for me also.
i've told this story before.
i'll never forget watching my own mother, as she fought cancer in her final days, spending time worrying about whether her insurer would claim her illness was a preexisting condition so it could get out of providing coverage.
changing the current approach to preexisting conditions is the least we can do -- for my mother and for every other mother, father, son, and daughter, who has suffered under this practice, who've been paying premiums and don't get care.
we need to put health care within the reach for millions of americans.
now, even if we accept all of the economic and moral reasons for providing affordable coverage to all americans, there is no denying that expanding coverage will come at a cost, at least in the short run.
but it is a cost that will not -- i repeat -- will not add to our deficits.
i've set down a rule for my staff, for my team -- and i've said this to congress -- health care reform must be, and will be, deficit-neutral in the next decade.
now, there are already voices saying the numbers don't add up.
they're wrong.
here's why.
making health care affordable for all americans will cost somewhere on the order of $1 trillion over the next 10 years.
that's real money, even in washington.
but remember, that's less than we are projected to have spent on the war in iraq.
and also remember, failing to reform our health care system in a way that genuinely reduces cost growth will cost us trillions of dollars more in lost economic growth and lower wages.
that said, let me explain how we will cover the price tag.
first, as part of the budget that was passed a few months ago, we put aside $635 billion over 10 years in what we're calling a health reserve fund.
over half of that amount -- more than $300 billion -- will come from raising revenue by doing things like modestly limiting the tax deductions the wealthiest americans can take to the same level that it was at the end of the reagan years -- same level that it was under ronald reagan.
some are concerned that this will dramatically reduce charitable giving, for example, but statistics show that's not true.
and the best thing for our charities is the stronger economy that we will build with health care reform.
but we can't just raise revenues.
we're also going to have to make spending cuts, in part by examining inefficiencies in our current medicare program.
there are going to be robust debates about where these cuts should be made, and i welcome that debate.
but here's where i think these cuts should be made.
first, we should end overpayments to medicare advantage.
today, we're paying medicare advantage plans much more than we pay for traditional medicare services.
now, this is a good deal for insurance companies.
it's a subsidy to insurance companies.
it's not a good deal for you.
it's not a good deal for the american people.
and by the way, it doesn't follow free market principles, for those who are always talking about free market principles.
that's why we need to introduce competitive bidding into the medicare advantage program, a program under which private insurance companies are offering medicare coverage.
that alone will save $177 billion over the next decade, just that one step.
second, we need to use medicare reimbursements to reduce preventable hospital readmissions.
right now, almost 20 percent of medicare patients discharged from hospitals are readmitted within a month, often because they're not getting the comprehensive care that they need.
this puts people at risk; it drives up cost.
by changing how medicare reimburses hospitals, we can discourage them from acting in a way that boosts profits but drives up costs for everyone else.
that will save us $25 billion over the next decade.
third, we need to introduce generic biologic drugs into the marketplace.these are drugs used to treat illnesses like anemia.
but right now, there is no pathway at the fda for approving generic versions of these drugs.
creating such a pathway will save us billions of dollars.
we can save another roughly $30 billion by getting a better deal for our poorer seniors while asking our well-off seniors to pay a little more for their drugs.
so that's the bulk of what's in the health reserve fund.
i've also proposed saving another $313 billion in medicare and medicaid spending in several other ways.
one way is by adjusting medicare payments to reflect new advances and productivity gains in our economy.
right now, medicare payments are rising each year by more than they should.
these adjustments will create incentives for providers to deliver care more efficiently, and save us roughly $109 billion in the process.
another way we can achieve savings is by reducing payments to hospitals for treating uninsured people.
i know hospitals rely on these payments now, legitimately, because of the large number of uninsured patients that they treat.
but if we put in a system where people have coverage and the number of uninsured people goes down with our reforms, the amount we pay hospitals to treat uninsured people should go down, as well.
reducing these payments gradually, as more and more people have coverage, will save us over $106 billion.
and we'll make sure the difference goes to the hospitals that need it most.
we can also save about $75 billion through more efficient purchasing of prescription drugs.
and we can save about $1 billion more by rooting out waste, abuse, fraud throughout our health care system so that no one is charging more for a service than it's worth or charging a dime for a service that they don't provide.
let me be clear
: i'm committed to making these cuts in a way that protects our senior citizens.
in fact, these proposals will actually extend the life of the medicare trust fund by seven years, and reduce premiums for medicare beneficiaries by roughly $43 billion over the next 10 years.
and i'm working with aarp to uphold that commitment.
now, for those of you who took out your pencil and paper -- altogether, these savings mean that we've put about $950 billion on the table -- and that doesn't count some of the long-term savings that we think will come about from reform -- from medical it, for example, or increased investment in prevention.
so that stuff in congressional jargon is not scorable; the congressional budget office won't count that as savings, so we're setting that aside.
we think that's going to come, but even separate and far from that, we've put $950 billion on the table, taking us almost all the way to covering the full cost of health care reform.
in the weeks and months ahead, i look forward to working with congress to make up the difference so that health care reform is fully paid for -- in a real, accountable way.
and let me add that this does not count longer-term savings.
i just want to repeat that.
by insisting that the reforms that we're introducing are deficit-neutral over the next decade, and by making the reforms that will help slow the growth rate of health care costs over the coming decades -- bending the curve -- we can look forward to faster economic growth, higher living standards, and falling, instead of rising, budget deficits.
now, let me just wrap up by saying this.
i know people are cynical whether we can do this or not.
i know there will be disagreements about how to proceed in the days ahead.
there's probably healthy debate within the ama.
that's good.
i also know this:
we can't let this moment pass us by.
you know, the other day, a friend of mine, congressman earl blumenauer, handed me a magazine with a special issue titled, "the crisis in american medicine."
one article notes "soaring charges."
another warns about the "volume of utilization of services."
another asks if we can find a "better way than fee-for-service for paying for medical care.
" it speaks to many of the challenges we face today.
the thing is, this special issue was published by harper's magazine in october of 1960 -- before i was born.
members of the american medical association, and my fellow americans, i'm here today because i don't want our children and their children to still be speaking of a crisis in american medicine 50 years from now.
i don't want them to still be suffering from spiraling costs that we did not stem, or sicknesses that we did not cure.
i don't want them to be burdened with massive deficits we did not curb or a worsening economy that we did not rebuild.
i want them to benefit from a health care system that works for all of us; where families can open a doctor's bill without dreading what's inside; where parents are talking to their kids and getting them to get regular checkups, and testing themselves for preventable ailments; where parents are feeding their kids healthier food and kids are exercising more; where patients are spending more time with their doctors, and doctors can pull up on a computer all the medical information and latest research
they'll ever want to know to meet patients' needs; where orthopedists and nephrologists and oncologists are all working together to treat a single human being; where what's best about america's health care system has become the hallmark of america's health care system.
that's the health care system we can build.
that's the future
i'm convinced is within our reach.
and if we're willing to come together and bring about that future, then we will not only make americans healthier, we will not only unleash america's economic potential, but we will reaffirm the ideals that led you into this noble profession and we'll build a health care system that lets all americans heal.
thank you very much, ama.
appreciate it, thank you.
good afternoon.
thank you, president sarkozy, prime minister brown, prime minister harper, and prince charles for being here today.
thank you to our secretary of veterans affairs, general eric shinseki, for making the trip out here to join us.
thanks also to susan eisenhower, whose grandfather began this mission 65 years ago with a simple charge:
"ok, let's go."
and to a world war ii veteran who returned home from this war to serve a proud and distinguished career as a united states senator and a national leader:  bob dole.
i'm not the first american president to come and mark this anniversary, and i likely will not be the last.
this is an event that has long brought to this coast both heads of state and grateful citizens; veterans and their loved ones; the liberated and their liberators.
it's been written about and spoken of and depicted in countless books and films and speeches.
and long after our time on this earth has passed, one word will still bring forth the pride and awe of men and women who will never meet the heroes who sit before us:  d-day.
why is this?
of all the battles in all the wars across the span of human history, why does this day hold such a revered place in our memory?
what is it about the struggle that took place on the sands a few short steps from here that brings us back to remember year after year after year?
part of it, i think, is the size of the odds that weighed against success.
for three centuries, no invader had ever been able to cross the english channel into normandy.
and it had never been more difficult than in 1944.
that was the year that hitler ordered his top field marshal to fortify the atlantic wall against a seaborne invasion.
from the tip of norway to southern france, the nazis lined steep cliffs with machine guns and artillery.
low-lying areas were flooded to block passage.
sharpened poles awaited paratroopers.
mines were laid on the beaches and beneath the water.
and by the time of the invasion, half a million germans waited for the allies along the coast between holland and northern france.
at dawn on june 6th, the allies came.
the best chance for victory had been for the british royal air corps to take out the guns on the cliffs while airborne divisions parachuted behind enemy lines.
but all did not go according to plan.
paratroopers landed miles from their mark, while the fog and clouds prevented allied planes from destroying the guns on the cliffs.
so when the ships landed here at omaha, an unimaginable hell rained down on the men inside.
many never made it out of the boats.
and yet, despite all of this, one by one, the allied forces made their way to shore -- here, and at utah and juno; gold and sword.
they were american, british, and canadian.
soon, the paratroopers found each other and fought their way back.
the rangers scaled the cliffs.
and by the end of the day, against all odds, the ground on which we stand was free once more.
the sheer improbability of this victory is part of what makes d-day so memorable.
it also arises from the clarity of purpose with which this war was waged.
we live in a world of competing beliefs and claims about what is true.
it's a world of varied religions and cultures and forms of government.
in such a world, it's all too rare for a struggle to emerge that speaks to something universal about humanity.
the second world war did that.
no man who shed blood or lost a brother would say that war is good.
but all know that this war was essential.
for what we faced in nazi totalitarianism was not just a battle of competing interests.
it was a competing vision of humanity.
nazi ideology sought to subjugate and humiliate and exterminate.
it perpetrated murder on a massive scale, fueled by a hatred of those who were deemed different and therefore inferior.
it was evil.
the nations that joined together to defeat hitler's reich were not perfect.
they had made their share of mistakes, had not always agreed with one another on every issue.
but whatever god we prayed to, whatever our differences
, we knew that the evil we faced had to be stopped.
citizens of all faiths and of no faith came to believe that we could not remain as bystanders to the savage perpetration of death and destruction.
and so we joined and sent our sons to fight and often die so that men and women they never met might know what it is to be free.
in america, it was an endeavor that inspired a nation to action.
a president who asked his country to pray on d-day also asked its citizens to serve and sacrifice to make the invasion possible.
on farms and in factories, millions of men and women worked three shifts a day, month after month, year after year.
trucks and tanks came from plants in michigan and indiana, new york and illinois.
bombers and fighter planes rolled off assembly lines in ohio and kansas, where my grandmother did her part as an inspector.
shipyards on both coasts produced the largest fleet in history, including the landing craft from new orleans that eventually made it here to omaha.
but despite all the years of planning and preparation, despite the inspiration of our leaders, the skill of our generals, the strength of our firepower and the unyielding support from our home front, the outcome of the entire struggle would ultimately rest on the success of one day in june.
lyndon
johnson once said that there are certain moments when "¼history and fate meet at a single time in a single place to shape a turning point in man's unending search for freedom.
"
d-day was such a moment.
one newspaper noted that "we have come to the hour for which we were born."
had the allies failed here, hitler's occupation of this continent might have continued indefinitely.
instead, victory here secured a foothold in france.
it opened a path to berlin.
it made possible the achievements that followed the liberation of europe:
the marshall plan, the nato alliance, the shared prosperity and security that flowed from each.
it was unknowable then, but so much of the progress that would define the 20th century, on both sides of the atlantic, came down to the battle for a slice of beach only six miles long and two miles wide.
more particularly, it came down to the men who landed here -- those who now rest in this place for eternity, and those who are with us here today.
perhaps more than any other reason, you, the veterans of that landing, are why we still remember what happened on d-day.
you're why we keep coming back.
for you remind us that in the end, human destiny is not determined by forces beyond our control.
you remind us that our future is not shaped by mere chance or circumstance.
our history has always been the sum total of the choices made and the actions taken by each individual man and woman.
it has always been up to us.
you could have done what hitler believed you would do when you arrived here.
in the face of a merciless assault from these cliffs, you could have idled the boats offshore.
amid a barrage of tracer bullets that lit the night sky, you could have stayed in those planes.
you could have hid in the hedgerows or waited behind the seawall.
you could have done only what was necessary to ensure your own survival.
but that's not what you did.
that's not the story you told on d-day.
your story was written by men like zane schlemmer of the 82nd airborne, who parachuted into a dark marsh, far from his objective and his men.
lost and alone, he still managed to fight his way through the gunfire and help liberate the town in which he landed -- a town where a street now bears his name.
it's a story written by men like anthony ruggiero, an army ranger who saw half the men on his landing craft drown when it was hit by shellfire just a thousand yards off this beach.
he spent three hours in freezing water, and was one of only 90 rangers to survive out of the 225 who were sent to scale the cliffs.
and it's a story written by so many who are no longer with us, like carlton barrett.
private barrett was only supposed to serve as a guide for the 1st infantry division, but he instead became one of its heroes.
after wading ashore in neck-deep water, he returned to the water again and again and again to save his wounded and drowning comrades.
and under the heaviest possible enemy fire, he carried them to safety.
he carried them in his own arms.
this is the story of the allied victory.
it's the legend of units like easy company and the all-american 82nd.
it's the tale of the british people, whose courage during the blitz forced hitler to call off the invasion of england; the canadians, who came even though they were never attacked; the russians, who sustained some of the war's heaviest casualties on the eastern front; and all those french men and women who would rather have died resisting tyranny than lived within its grasp.
it is the memories that have been passed on to so many of us about the service or sacrifice of a friend or relative.
for me, it is my grandfather, stanley dunham, who arrived on this beach six weeks after d-day and marched across europe in patton's army.
and it is my great uncle who was part of the first american division to reach and liberate a nazi concentration camp.
his name is charles payne, and i'm so proud that he's with us here today.
i know this trip doesn't get any easier as the years pass, but for those of you who make it, there's nothing that could keep you away.
one such veteran, a man named jim norene, was a member of the 502nd parachute infantry division of the 101st airborne.
last night, after visiting this cemetery for one last time, he passed away in his sleep.
jim was gravely ill when he left his home, and he knew that he might not return.
but just as he did 65 years ago, he came anyway.
may he now rest in peace with the boys he once bled with, and may his family always find solace in the heroism he showed here.
in the end, jim norene came back to normandy for the same reason we all come back.
he came for the reason articulated by howard huebner, another former paratrooper who is here with us today.
when asked why he made the trip, howard said, "it's important that we tell our stories.
it doesn't have to be something
big¼just a little story about what happened -- so people don't forget.
"
so people don't forget.
friends and veterans, we cannot forget.
what we must not forget is that d-day was a time and a place where the bravery and the selflessness of a few was able to change the course of an entire century.
at an hour of maximum danger, amid the bleakest of circumstances, men who thought themselves ordinary found within themselves the ability to do something extraordinary.
they fought for their moms and sweethearts back home, for the fellow warriors they came to know as brothers.
and they fought out of a simple sense of duty -- a duty sustained by the same ideals for which their countrymen had once fought and bled for over two centuries.
that is the story of normandy -- but also the story of america; of the minutemen who gathered on a green in lexington; of the union boys from maine who repelled a charge at gettysburg; of the men who gave their last full measure of devotion at inchon and khe san; of all the young men and women whose valor and goodness still carry forward this legacy of service and sacrifice.
it's a story that has never come easy, but one that always gives us hope.
for as we face down the hardships and struggles of our time, and arrive at that hour for which we were born, we cannot help but draw strength from those moments in history when the best among us were somehow able to swallow their fears and secure a beachhead on an unforgiving shore.
to those men who achieved that victory 65 years ago, we thank you for your service.
may god bless you, and may god bless the memory of all those who rest here.
chancellor merkel and
i have just finished our tour here at buchenwald.
i want to thank dr. volkhard knigge, who gave an outstanding account of what we were witnessing.
i am particularly grateful to be accompanied by my friend elie wiesel, as well as mr. bertrand herz, both of whom are survivors of this place.
we saw the area known as little camp where elie and bertrand were sent as boys.
in fact, at the place that commemorates this camp, there is a photograph in which we can see a 16-year-old elie in one of the bunks along with the others.
we saw the ovens of the crematorium, the guard towers, the barbed wire fences, the foundations of barracks that once held people in the most unimaginable conditions.
we saw the memorial to all the survivors -- a steel plate, as chancellor merkel said, that is heated to 37 degrees celsius, the temperature of the human body; a reminder -- where people were deemed inhuman because of their differences -- of the mark that we all share.
now these sights have not lost their horror with the passage of time.
as we were walking up, elie said, "if these trees could talk."
and there's a certain irony about the beauty of the landscape and the horror that took place here.
more than half a century later, our grief and our outrage over what happened have not diminished.
i will not forget what i've seen here today.
i've known about this place since i was a boy, hearing stories about my great uncle, who was a very young man serving in world war ii.
he was part of the 89th infantry division, the first americans to reach a concentration camp.
they liberated ohrdruf, one of buchenwald's sub-camps.
and i told this story, he returned from his service in a state of shock saying little and isolating himself for months on end from family and friends, alone with the painful memories that would not leave his head.
and as we see -- as we saw some of the images here, it's understandable that someone who witnessed what had taken place here would be in a state of shock.
my great uncle's commander, general eisenhower, understood this impulse to silence.
he had seen the piles of bodies and starving survivors and deplorable conditions that the american soldiers found when they arrived, and he knew that those who witnessed these things might be too stunned to speak about them or be able -- be unable to find the words to describe them; that they might be rendered mute in the way my great uncle had.
and he knew that what had happened here was so unthinkable that after the bodies had been taken away, that perhaps no one would believe it.
and that's why he ordered american troops and germans from the nearby town to tour the camp.
he invited congressmen and journalists to bear witness and ordered photographs and films to be made.
and he insisted on viewing every corner of these camps so that -- and i quote -- he could "be in a position to give first-hand evidence of these things if ever in the future
there develops a tendency to charge these allegations merely to propaganda.
"
we are here today because we know this work is not yet finished.
to this day, there are those who insist that the holocaust never happened -- a denial of fact and truth that is baseless and ignorant and hateful.
this place is the ultimate rebuke to such thoughts; a reminder of our duty to confront those who would tell lies about our history.
also to this day, there are those who perpetuate every form of intolerance -- racism, anti-semitism, homophobia, xenophobia, sexism, and more -- hatred that degrades its victims and diminishes us all.
in this century, we've seen genocide.
we've seen mass graves and the ashes of villages burned to the ground; children used as soldiers and rape used as a weapon of war.
this places teaches us that we must be ever vigilant about the spread of evil in our own time, that we must reject the false comfort that others' suffering is not our problem and commit ourselves to resisting those who would subjugate others to serve their own interests.
but as we reflect today on the human capacity for evil and our shared obligation to defy it, we're also reminded of the human capacity for good.
for amidst the countless acts of cruelty that took place here, we know that there were many acts of courage and kindness, as well.
the jews who insisted on fasting on yom kippur.
the camp cook who hid potatoes in the lining of his prison uniform and distributed them to his fellow inmates, risking his own life to help save theirs.
the prisoners who organized a special effort to protect the children here, sheltering them from work and giving them extra food.
they set up secret classrooms, some of the inmates, and taught history and math and urged the children to think about their future professions.
and we were just hearing about the resistance that formed and the irony that the base for the resistance was in the latrine areas because the guards found it so offensive that they wouldn't go there.
and so out of the filth, that became a space in which small freedoms could thrive.
when the american gis arrived they were astonished to find more than 900 children still alive, and the youngest was just three years old.
and i'm told that a couple of the prisoners even wrote a buchenwald song that many here sang.
among the lyrics were these: "...
whatever our fate, we will say yes to life, for the day will come when we are free...
in our blood we carry the will to live and in our hearts, in our hearts -- faith."
these individuals never could have known the world would one day speak of this place.
they could not have known that some of them would live to have children and grandchildren who would grow up hearing their stories and would return here so many years later to find a museum and memorials and the clock tower set permanently to 3:15, the moment of liberation.
they could not have known how the nation of israel would rise out of the destruction of the holocaust and the strong, enduring bonds between that great nation and my own.
and they could not have known that one day an american president would visit this place and speak of them and that he would do so standing side by side with the german chancellor in a germany that is now a vibrant democracy and a valued american ally.
they could not have known these things.
but still surrounded by death they willed themselves to hold fast to life.
in their hearts they still had faith that evil would not triumph in the end, that while history is unknowable it arches towards progress, and that the world would one day remember them.
and it is now up to us, the living, in our work, wherever we are, to resist injustice and intolerance and indifference in whatever forms they may take, and ensure that those who were lost here did not go in vain.
it is up to us to redeem that faith.
it is up to us to bear witness; to ensure that the world continues to note what happened here; to remember all those who survived and all those who perished, and to remember them not just as victims, but also as individuals who hoped and loved and dreamed just like us.
and just as we identify with the victims, it's also important for us
i think to remember that the perpetrators of such evil were human, as well, and that we have to guard against cruelty in ourselves.
and i want to express particular thanks to chancellor merkel and the german people, because it's not easy to look into the past in this way and acknowledge it and make something of it, make a determination that they will stand guard against acts like this happening again.
rather than have me end with my remarks
i thought it was appropriate to have elie wiesel provide some reflection and some thought as he returns here so many years later to the place where his father died.
thank you so much.
good afternoon.
i am honored to be in the timeless city of cairo, and to be hosted by two remarkable institutions.
for over a thousand years, al-azhar has stood as a beacon of islamic learning; and for over a century, cairo university has been a source of egypt's advancement.
and together, you represent the harmony between tradition and progress.
i'm grateful for your hospitality and the hospitality of the people of egypt.
and i'm also proud to carry with me the goodwill of the american people, and a greeting of peace from muslim communities in my country:
assalaamu alaykum [peace be upon you].
we meet at a time of great tension between the united states and muslims around the world, tension rooted in historical forces that go beyond any current policy debate.
the relationship between islam and the west includes centuries of coexistence and cooperation, but also conflict and religious wars.
more recently, tension has been fed by colonialism that denied rights and opportunities to many muslims, and a cold war in which muslim-majority countries were too often treated as proxies without regard to their own aspirations.
moreover, the sweeping change brought by modernity and globalization led many muslims to view the west as hostile to the traditions of islam.
violent extremists have exploited these tensions in a small but potent minority of muslims.
the attacks of september 11, 2001 and the continued efforts of these extremists to engage in violence against civilians has led some in my country to view islam as inevitably hostile not only to america and western countries, but also to human rights.
all this has bred more fear and more mistrust.
so long as our relationship is defined by our differences, we will empower those who sow hatred rather than peace, those who promote conflict rather than the cooperation that can help all of our people achieve justice and prosperity.
and this cycle of suspicion and discord must end.
i've come here to cairo to seek a new beginning between the united states and muslims around the world, one based on mutual interest and mutual respect, and one based upon the truth that america and islam are not exclusive and need not be in competition.
instead, they overlap and share common principles -- principles of justice and progress, tolerance and the dignity of all human beings.
i do so recognizing that change cannot happen overnight.
i know there's been a lot of publicity about this speech, but no single speech can eradicate years of mistrust, nor can i answer in the time that i have this afternoon
all the complex questions that brought us to this point.
but i am convinced that in order to move forward, we must say openly to each other the things we hold in our hearts and that too often are said only behind closed doors.
there must be a sustained effort to listen to each other, to learn from each other, to respect one another, and to seek common ground.
as the holy qur’an tells us, "be conscious of god and speak always the truth.
" that is what i will try to do today -- to speak the truth as best i can, humbled by the task before us, and firm in my belief that the interests we share as human beings are far more powerful than the forces that drive us apart.
now part of this conviction is rooted in my own experience.
i'm a christian, but my father came from a kenyan family that includes generations of muslims.
as a boy, i spent several years in indonesia and heard the call of the azaan at the break of dawn and at the fall of dusk.
as a young man, i worked in chicago communities where many found dignity and peace in their muslim faith.
as a student of history, i also know civilization's debt to islam.
it was islam -- at places like al-azhar -- that carried the light of learning through so many centuries, paving the way for europe's renaissance and enlightenment.
it was innovation in muslim communities -- it was innovation in muslim communities that developed the order of algebra, our magnetic compass and tools of navigation, our mastery of pens and printing, our understanding of how disease spreads and how it can be healed.
islamic culture has given us majestic arches and soaring spires; timeless poetry and cherished music; elegant calligraphy and places of peaceful contemplation.
and throughout history, islam has demonstrated through words and deeds the possibilities of religious tolerance and racial equality.
i also know that islam has always been a part of america's story.
the first nation to recognize my country was morocco.
in signing the treaty of tripoli in 1796, our second president, john adams, wrote, "the united states has in itself no character of enmity against the laws, religion, or tranquility of muslims."
and since our founding, american muslims have enriched the united states.
they have fought in our wars; they have served in our government; they have stood for civil rights; they have started businesses; they have taught at our universities; they've excelled in our sports arenas; they've won nobel prizes, built our tallest building, and lit the olympic torch.
and when the first muslim american was recently elected to congress, he took the oath to defend our constitution using the same holy qur’an that one of our founding fathers -- thomas jefferson -- kept in his personal library.
so i have known islam on three continents before coming to the region where it was first revealed.
that experience guides my conviction that partnership between america and islam must be based on what islam is, not what it isn't.
and i consider it part of my responsibility as president of the united states to fight against negative stereotypes of islam wherever they appear.
but, that same principle must apply to muslim perceptions of america.
just as muslims -- just as muslims do not fit a crude stereotype, america is not the crude stereotype of a self-interested empire.
the united states has been one of the greatest sources of progress that the world has ever known.
we were born out of revolution against an empire.
we were founded upon the ideal that all are created equal.
and we have shed blood and struggled for centuries to give meaning to those words -- within our borders and around the world.
we are shaped by every culture, drawn from every end of the earth, and dedicated to a simple concept: e pluribus unum -- "out of many, one."
now much has been made of the fact that an african american with the name barack hussein obama could be elected president.
but my personal story is not so unique.
the dream of opportunity for all people has not come true for everyone in america, but its promise exists for all who come to our shores -- and that includes nearly 7 million american muslims in our country today who, by the way, enjoy incomes and educational levels that are higher than the american average.
moreover, freedom in america is indivisible from the freedom to practice one's religion.
that is why there is a mosque in every state in our union, and over 1200 mosques within our borders.
that's why the united states government has gone to court to protect the right of women and girls to wear the hijab -- and to punish those who would deny it.
so let there be no doubt -- let there be no doubt:
islam is a part of america.
and i believe that america holds within her the truth that regardless of race, religion, or station in life, all of us share common aspirations -- to live in peace and security; to get an education and to work with dignity; to love our families, our communities, and our god.
these things we share.
this is the hope of all humanity.
of course, recognizing our common humanity is only the beginning of our task.
words alone cannot meet the needs of our people.
these needs will be met only if we act boldly in the years ahead, and if we understand that the challenges we face are shared and our failure to meet them will hurt us all.
for we have learned from recent experience that when a financial system weakens in one country, prosperity is hurt everywhere.
when a new flu infects one human being, all are at risk.
when one nation pursues a nuclear weapon, the risk of nuclear attack rises for all nations.
when violent extremists operate in one stretch of mountains, people are endangered across an ocean.
when innocents in bosnia and darfur are slaughtered, that is a stain on our collective conscience.
that is what it means to share this world in the 21st century.
that is the responsibility we have to one another as human beings.
and this is a difficult responsibility to embrace.
for human history has often been a record of nations and tribes -- and, yes, religions -- subjugating one another in pursuit of their own interests.
yet in this new age, such attitudes are self-defeating.
given our interdependence, any world order that elevates one nation or group of people over another will inevitably fail.
so whatever we think of the past, we must not be prisoners to it.
our problems must be dealt with through partnership; our progress must be shared.
now, that does not mean we should ignore sources of tension.
indeed, it suggests the opposite:
we must face these tensions squarely.
and so in that spirit, let me speak as clearly and as plainly as i can about some specific issues that i believe we must finally confront together.
the first issue that we have to confront is violent extremism in all of its forms.
in ankara, i made clear that america is not -- and never will be -- at war with islam.
we will, however, relentlessly confront violent extremists who pose a grave threat to our security -- because we reject the same thing that people of all faiths reject: the killing of innocent men, women, and children.
and it is my first duty as president to protect the american people.
the situation in afghanistan demonstrates america's goals, and our need to work together.
over seven years ago, the united states pursued al qaeda and the taliban with broad international support.
we did not go by choice; we went because of necessity.
i'm aware that there's still some who would question or even justify the events of 9/11.
but let us be clear: al qaeda killed nearly 3,000 people on that day.
the victims were innocent men, women, and children from america and many other nations who had done nothing to harm anybody.
and yet al qaeda chose to ruthlessly murder these people, claimed credit for the attack, and even now states their determination to kill on a massive scale.
they have affiliates in many countries and are trying to expand their reach.
these are not opinions to be debated; these are facts to be dealt with.
now, make no mistake: we do not want to keep our troops in afghanistan.
we see no military -- we seek no military bases there.
it is agonizing for america to lose our young men and women.
it is costly and politically difficult to continue this conflict.
we would gladly bring every single one of our troops home if we could be confident that there were not violent extremists in afghanistan and now pakistan determined to kill as many americans as they possibly can.
but that is not yet the case.
and that's why we're partnering with a coalition of 46 countries.
and despite the costs involved, america's commitment will not weaken.
indeed, none of us should tolerate these extremists.
they have killed in many countries.
they have killed people of different faiths.
but more than any other, they have killed muslims.
their actions are irreconcilable with the rights of human beings, the progress of nations, and with islam.
the qur’an teaches that whoever kills an innocent is as -- it is as if he has killed all mankind.
and the holy qur’an also says whoever -- whoever saves a person, it is as if he has saved all mankind.
the enduring faith of over a billion people is so much bigger than the narrow hatred of a few.
islam is not part of the problem in combating violent extremism -- it is an important part of promoting peace.
now, we also know that military power alone is not going to solve the problems in afghanistan and pakistan.
that's why we plan to invest 1.5 billion dollars each year over the next five years to partner with pakistanis to build schools and hospitals, roads and businesses, and hundreds of millions to help those who've been displaced.
that's why we are providing more than 2.8 billion dollars to help afghans develop their economy and deliver services that people depend on.
let me also address the issue of iraq.
unlike afghanistan, iraq was a war of choice that provoked strong differences in my country and around the world.
although i believe that the iraqi people are ultimately better off without the tyranny of saddam hussein, i also believe that events in iraq have reminded america of the need to use diplomacy and build international consensus to resolve our problems whenever possible.
indeed, we can recall the words of thomas jefferson, who said: "i hope that our wisdom will grow with our power, and teach us that the less we use our power the greater it will be."
today, america has a dual responsibility: to help iraq forge a better future; and to leave iraq to iraqis.
and i have made it clear to the iraqi people
-- i have made it clear to the iraqi people that we pursue no bases, and no claim on their territory or resources.
iraq's sovereignty is its own.
and that's why i ordered the removal of our combat brigades by next august.
that is why we will honor our agreement with iraq's democratically elected government to remove combat troops from iraqi cities by july, and to remove all of our troops from iraq by 2012.
we will help iraq train its security forces and develop its economy.
but we will support a secure and united iraq as a partner, and never as a patron.
and finally, just as america can never tolerate violence by extremists, we must never alter or forget our principles.
nine-eleven was an enormous trauma to our country.
the fear and anger that it provoked was understandable, but in some cases it led us to act contrary to our traditions and our ideals.
we are taking concrete actions to change course.
i have unequivocally prohibited the use of torture by the united states, and i have ordered the prison at guantanamo bay closed by early next year.
so america will defend itself, respectful of the sovereignty of nations and the rule of law.
and we will do so in partnership with muslim communities which are also threatened.
the sooner the extremists are isolated and unwelcome in muslim communities, the sooner we will all be safer.
the second major source of tension that we need to discuss is the situation between israelis, palestinians, and the arab world.
america's strong bonds with israel are well known.
this bond is unbreakable.
it is based upon cultural and historical ties, and the recognition that the aspiration for a jewish homeland is rooted in a tragic history that cannot be denied.
around the world, the jewish people were persecuted for centuries, and anti-semitism in europe culminated in an unprecedented holocaust.
tomorrow, i will visit buchenwald, which was part of a network of camps where jews were enslaved, tortured, shot, and gassed to death by the third reich.
six million jews were killed -- more than the entire jewish population of israel today.
denying that fact is baseless; it is ignorant; and it is hateful.
threatening israel with destruction, or repeating vile stereotypes about jews, is deeply wrong and only serves to evoke in the minds of israelis this most painful of memories while preventing the peace that the people of this region deserve.
on the other hand, it is also undeniable that the palestinian people -- muslims and christians -- has suffered in pursuit of a homeland.
for more than 60 years they've endured the pain of dislocation.
many wait in refugee camps in the west bank, gaza, and neighboring lands for a life of peace and security that they have never been able to lead.
they endure the daily humiliations -- large and small -- that come with occupation.
so let there be no doubt: the situation for the palestinian people is intolerable.
and america will not turn our backs on the legitimate palestinian aspiration for dignity, opportunity, and a state of their own.
for decades then, there has been a stalemate: two peoples with legitimate aspirations, each with a painful history that makes compromise elusive.
it's easy to point fingers -- for palestinians to point to the displacement brought about by israel's founding, and for israelis to point to the constant hostility and attacks throughout its history from within its borders as well as beyond.
but if we see this conflict only from one side or the other, then we will be blind to the truth: the only resolution is for the aspirations of both sides to be met through two states, where israelis and palestinians each live in peace and security.
that is in israel's interest, palestine's interest, america's interest, and the world's interest.
and that is why i intend to personally pursue this outcome with all the patience and dedication that the task requires.
the obligations -- the obligations that the parties have agreed to under the road map are clear.
for peace to come, it is time for them -- and all of us -- to live up to our responsibilities.
palestinians must abandon violence.
resistance through violence and killing is wrong and it does not succeed.
for centuries, black people in america suffered the lash of the whip as slaves and the humiliation of segregation.
but it was not violence that won full and equal rights.
it was a peaceful and determined insistence upon the ideals at the center of america's founding.
this same story can be told by people from south africa to south asia; from eastern europe to indonesia.
it's a story with a simple truth: violence is a dead end.
it is a sign neither of courage nor power to shoot rockets at sleeping children, or to blow up old women on a bus.
that's not how moral authority is claimed; that's how it is surrendered.
now is the time for palestinians to focus on what they can build.
the palestinian authority must develop its capacity to govern, with institutions that serve the needs of its peoples.
hamas does have support among some palestinians, but they also have to recognize they have responsibilities.
to play a role in fulfilling palestinian aspirations, to unify the palestinian people, hamas must put an end to violence, recognize past agreements, recognize israel's right to exist.
at the same time, israelis must acknowledge that just as israel's right to exist cannot be denied, neither can palestine's.
the united states does not accept the legitimacy of continued israeli settlements.
this construction violates previous agreements and undermines efforts to achieve peace.
it is time for these settlements to stop.
and israel must also live up to its obligation to ensure that palestinians can live and work and develop their society.
just as it devastates palestinian families, the continuing humanitarian crisis in gaza does not serve israel's security; neither does the continuing lack of opportunity in the west bank.
progress in the daily lives of the palestinian people must be a critical part of a road to peace, and israel must take concrete steps to enable such progress.
and finally, the arab states must recognize that the arab peace initiative was an important beginning, but not the end of their responsibilities.
the arab-israeli conflict should no longer be used to distract the people of arab nations from other problems.
instead, it must be a cause for action to help the palestinian people develop the institutions that will sustain their state, to recognize israel's legitimacy, and to choose progress over a self-defeating focus on the past.
america will align our policies with those who pursue peace, and we will say in public what we say in private to israelis and palestinians and arabs.
we cannot impose peace.
but privately, many muslims recognize that israel will not go away.
likewise, many israelis recognize the need for a palestinian state.
it is time for us to act on what everyone knows to be true.
too many tears have been shed.
too much blood has been shed.
all of us have a responsibility to work for the day when the mothers of israelis and palestinians can see their children grow up without fear; when the holy land of the three great faiths is the place of peace that god intended it to be; when jerusalem is a secure and lasting home for jews and christians and muslims, and a place for all of the children of abraham to mingle peacefully together as in the story of isra -- as in the story of isra, when moses, jesus, and mohammed, peace be upon them, joined in prayer.
the third source of tension is our shared interest in the rights and responsibilities of nations on nuclear weapons.
this issue has been a source of tension between the united states and the islamic republic of iran.
for many years, iran has defined itself in part by its opposition to my country, and there is in fact a tumultuous history between us.
in the middle of the cold war, the united states played a role in the overthrow of a democratically elected iranian government.
since the islamic revolution, iran has played a role in acts of hostage-taking and violence against u.s. troops and civilians.
this history is well known.
rather than remain trapped in the past, i've made it clear to iran's leaders and people that my country is prepared to move forward.
the question now is not what iran is against, but rather what future it wants to build.
i recognize it will be hard to overcome decades of mistrust, but we will proceed with courage, rectitude, and resolve.
there will be many issues to discuss between our two countries, and we are willing to move forward without preconditions on the basis of mutual respect.
but it is clear to all concerned that when it comes to nuclear weapons, we have reached a decisive point.
this is not simply about america's interests.
it's about preventing a nuclear arms race in the middle east that could lead this region and the world down a hugely dangerous path.
i understand those who protest that some countries have weapons that others do not.
no single nation should pick and choose which nation holds nuclear weapons.
and that's why i strongly reaffirmed america's commitment to seek a world in which no nations hold nuclear weapons.
and any nation -- including iran -- should have the right to access peaceful nuclear power if it complies with its responsibilities under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.
that commitment is at the core of the treaty, and it must be kept for all who fully abide by it.
and i am hopeful that all countries in the region can share in this goal.
the fourth issue that i will address is democracy.
i know --
i know there has been controversy about the promotion of democracy in recent years, and much of this controversy is connected to the war in iraq.
so let me be clear: no system of government can or should be imposed by one nation by any other.
that does not lessen my commitment, however, to governments that reflect the will of the people.
each nation gives life to this principle in its own way, grounded in the traditions of its own people.
america does not presume to know what is best for everyone, just as we would not presume to pick the outcome of a peaceful election.
but i do have an unyielding belief that all people yearn for certain things:
the ability to speak your mind and have a say in how you are governed; confidence in the rule of law and the equal administration of justice; government that is transparent and doesn't steal from the people; the freedom to live as you choose.
these are not just american ideas; they are human rights.
and that is why we will support them everywhere.
now, there is no straight line to realize this promise.
but this much is clear: governments that protect these rights are ultimately more stable, successful, and secure.
suppressing ideas never succeeds in making them go away.
america -- america respects the right of all peaceful and law-abiding voices to be heard around the world, even if we disagree with them.
and we will welcome all elected, peaceful governments --
provided they govern with respect for all their people.
this last point is important because there are some who advocate for democracy only when they're out of power.
once in power, they are ruthless in suppressing the rights of others.
so no matter where it takes hold, government of the people and by the people sets a single standard for all who would hold power
: you must maintain your power through consent, not
coercion
; you must respect the rights of minorities, and participate with a spirit of tolerance and compromise; you must place the interests of your people and the legitimate workings of the political process above your party.
without these ingredients, elections alone do not make true democracy.
thank you.
the fifth issue that we must address together is religious freedom.
islam has a proud tradition of tolerance.
we see it in the history of andalusia and cordoba during the inquisition.
i saw it firsthand as a child in indonesia, where devout christians worshiped freely in an overwhelmingly muslim country.
that is the spirit we need today.
people in every country should be free to choose and live their faith based upon the persuasion of the mind and the heart and the soul.
this tolerance is essential for religion to thrive, but it's being challenged in many different ways.
among some muslims, there's a disturbing tendency to measure one's own faith by the rejection of somebody else's faith.
the richness of religious diversity must be upheld -- whether it is for maronites in lebanon or the copts in egypt.
and if we are being honest, fault lines must be closed among muslims, as well, as the divisions between sunni and shia have led to tragic violence, particularly in iraq.
freedom of religion is central to the ability of peoples to live together.
we must always examine the ways in which we protect it.
for instance, in the united states, rules on charitable giving have made it harder for muslims to fulfill their religious obligation.
that's why i'm committed to working with american muslims to ensure that they can fulfill zakat.
likewise, it is important for western countries to avoid impeding muslim citizens from practicing religion as they see fit -- for instance, by dictating what clothes a muslim woman should wear.
we can't disguise hostility towards any religion behind the pretence of liberalism.
in fact, faith should bring us together.
and that's why we're forging service projects in america to bring together christians, muslims, and jews.
that's why we welcome efforts like saudi arabian king abdullah's interfaith dialogue and turkey's leadership in the alliance of civilizations.
around the world, we can turn dialogue into interfaith service, so bridges between peoples lead to action -- whether it is combating malaria in africa, or providing relief after a natural disaster.
the sixth issue -- the sixth issue that i want to address is women's rights.
i know --- i know
-- and you can tell from this audience, that there is a healthy debate about this issue.
i reject the view of some in the west that a woman who chooses to cover her hair is somehow less equal, but i do believe that a woman who is denied an education is denied equality.
and it is no coincidence that countries where women are well educated are far more likely to be prosperous.
now, let me be clear: issues of women's equality are by no means simply an issue for islam.
in turkey, pakistan, bangladesh, indonesia, we've seen muslim-majority countries elect a woman to lead.
meanwhile, the struggle for women's equality continues in many aspects of american life, and in countries around the world.
i am convinced that our daughters can contribute just as much to society as our sons.
our common prosperity will be advanced by allowing all humanity -- men and women -- to reach their full potential.
i do not believe that women must make the same choices as men in order to be equal, and i respect those women who choose to live their lives in traditional roles.
but it should be their choice.
and that is why the united states will partner with any muslim-majority country to support expanded literacy for girls, and to help young women pursue employment through micro-financing that helps people live their dreams.
finally, i want to discuss economic development and opportunity.
i know that for many, the face of globalization is contradictory.
the internet and television can bring knowledge and information, but also offensive sexuality and mindless violence into the home.
trade can bring new wealth and opportunities, but also huge disruptions and change in communities.
in all nations -- including america -- this change can bring fear; fear that because of modernity we lose control over our economic choices, our politics, and most importantly our identities -- those things we most cherish about our communities, our families, our traditions, and our faith.
but i also know that human progress cannot be denied.
there need not be contradictions between development and tradition.
countries like japan and south korea grew their economies enormously while maintaining distinct cultures.
the same is true for the astonishing progress within muslim-majority countries from kuala lumpur to dubai.
in ancient times and in our times, muslim communities have been at the forefront of innovation and education.
and this is important because no development strategy can be based only upon what comes out of the ground, nor can it be sustained while young people are out of work.
many gulf states have enjoyed great wealth as a consequence of oil, and some are beginning to focus it on broader development.
but all of us must recognize that education and innovation will be the currency of the 21st century -- and in too -- and in too many muslim communities, there remains underinvestment in these areas.
i'm emphasizing such investment within my own country.
and while america in the past has focused on oil and gas when it comes to this part of the world, we now seek a broader engagement.
on education, we will expand exchange programs, and increase scholarships, like the one that brought my father to america.
at the same time, we will encourage more americans to study in muslim communities.
and we will match promising muslim students with internships in america, invest in online learning for teachers and children around the world, and create a new online network, so a young person in kansas can communicate instantly with a young person in cairo.
on economic development, we will create a new corps of business volunteers to partner with counterparts in muslim-majority countries.
and i will host a summit on entrepreneurship this year to identify how we can deepen ties between business leaders, foundations, and social entrepreneurs in the united states and muslim communities around the world.
on science and technology, we will launch a new fund to support technological development in muslim-majority countries, and to help transfer ideas to -- to the marketplace so they can create more jobs.
we'll open centers of scientific excellence in africa, the middle east and southeast asia, and appoint new science envoys to collaborate on programs that develop new sources of energy, create green jobs, digitize records, clean water, grow new crops.
today i'm announcing a new global effort with the organization of the islamic conference to eradicate polio.
and we will also expand partnerships with muslim communities to promote child and maternal health.
all these things must be done in partnership.
americans are ready to join with citizens and governments; community organizations, religious leaders, and businesses in muslim communities around the world to help our people pursue a better life.
now the issues that i have described will not be easy to address.
but we have a responsibility to join together on behalf of the world that we seek -- a world where extremists no longer threaten our people, and american troops have come home; a world where israelis and palestinians are each secure in a state of their own, and nuclear energy is used for peaceful purposes; a world where governments serve their citizens, and the rights of all god's children are respected.
those are mutual interests.
that is the world we seek.
but we can only achieve it together.
i know there are many, muslim and non-muslim, who question whether we can forge this new beginning.
some are eager to stoke the flames of division, and to stand in the way of progress.
some suggest that it isn't worth the effort -- that we are fated to disagree, and civilizations are doomed to clash.
many more are simply skeptical that real change can occur.
there's so much fear, so much mistrust that has built up over the years.
but if we choose to be bound by the past, we will never move forward.
and i want to particularly say this to young people of every faith, in every country
: you, more than anyone, have the ability to reimagine the world, to remake this world.
all of us share this world for but a brief moment in time.
the question is whether we spend that time focused on what pushes us apart, or whether we commit ourselves to an effort -- a sustained effort -- to find common ground, to focus on the future we seek for our children, and to respect the dignity of all human beings.
it's easier to start wars than to end them.
it's easier to blame others than to look inward.
it's easier to see what is different about someone than to find the things we share.
but we should choose the right path, not just the easy path.
there's one rule that lies at the heart of every religion -- that we do unto others as we would have them do unto us.
this truth transcends nations and peoples -- a belief that isn't new; that isn't black or white or brown; that isn't christian or muslim or jew.
it's a belief that pulsed in the cradle of civilization, and that still beats in the hearts of billions around the world.
it's a faith in other people, and it's what brought me here today.
we have the power to make the world we seek, but only if we have the courage to make a new beginning, keeping in mind what has been written.
the holy qur’an tells us: "o mankind!
we have created you male and a female; and we have made you into nations and tribes so that you may know one another."
the talmud tells us: "the whole of the torah is for the purpose of promoting peace."
the holy bible tells us: "blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of god."
the people of the world can live together in peace.
we know that is god's vision.
now that must be our work here on earth.
thank you.
and may god's peace be upon you.
thank you very much.
thank you.
we meet today at a transformational moment -- a moment in history when our interconnected world presents us, at once, with great promise but also great peril.
now, over the past four months my administration has taken decisive steps to seize the promise and confront these perils.
we're working to recover from a global recession while laying a new foundation for lasting prosperity.
we're strengthening our armed forces as they fight two wars, at the same time we're renewing american leadership to confront unconventional challenges, from nuclear proliferation to terrorism, from climate change to pandemic disease.
and we're bringing to government -- and to this white house -- unprecedented transparency and accountability and new ways for americans to participate in their democracy.
but none of this progress would be possible, and none of these 21st century challenges can be fully met, without america's digital infrastructure -- the backbone that underpins a prosperous economy and a strong military and an open and efficient government.
without that foundation we can't get the job done.
it's long been said that the revolutions in communications and information technology have given birth to a virtual world.
but make no mistake: this world -- cyberspace -- is a world that we depend on every single day.
it's our hardware and our software, our desktops and laptops and cell phones and blackberries that have become woven into every aspect of our lives.
it's the broadband networks beneath us and the wireless signals around us, the local networks in our schools and hospitals and businesses, and the massive grids that power our nation.
it's the classified military and intelligence networks that keep us safe, and the world wide web that has made us more interconnected than at any time in human history.
so cyberspace is real.
and so are the risks that come with it.
it's the great irony of our information age -- the very technologies that empower us to create and to build
also empower those who would disrupt and destroy.
and this paradox -- seen and unseen -- is something that we experience every day.
it's about the privacy and the economic security of american families.
we rely on the internet to pay our bills, to bank, to shop, to file our taxes.
but we've had to learn a whole new vocabulary just to stay ahead of the cyber criminals who would do us harm: spyware and malware and spoofing and phishing and botnets.
millions of americans have been victimized, their privacy violated, their identities stolen, their lives upended, and their wallets emptied.
according to one survey, in the past two years alone cyber crime has cost americans more than 8 billion dollars.
i know how it feels to have privacy violated because it has happened to me and the people around me.
it's no secret that my presidential campaign harnessed the internet and technology to transform our politics.
what isn't widely known is that during the general election hackers managed to penetrate our computer systems.
to all of you who donated to our campaign, i want you to all rest assured, our fundraising website was untouched.
so your confidential personal and financial information was protected.
but between august and october, hackers gained access to emails and a range of campaign files, from policy position papers to travel plans.
and we worked closely with the cia, with the fbi and the secret service, and hired security consultants to restore the security of our systems.
it was a powerful reminder: in this information age, one of your greatest strengths -- in our case, our ability to communicate to a wide range of supporters through the internet -- could also be one of your greatest vulnerabilities.
this is a matter, as well, of america's economic competitiveness.
the small businesswoman in st. louis, the bond trader in the new york stock exchange, the workers at a global shipping company in memphis, the young entrepreneur in silicon valley -- they all need the networks to make the next payroll, the next trade, the next delivery,
the next great breakthrough.
e-commerce alone last year accounted for some 132 billion dollars in retail sales.
but every day we see waves of cyber thieves trolling for sensitive information --
the disgruntled employee on the inside, the lone hacker a thousand miles away, organized crime, the industrial spy and, increasingly, foreign intelligence services.
in one brazen act last year, thieves used stolen credit card information to steal millions of dollars from 130 atm machines in 49 cities around the world -- and they did it in just 30 minutes.
a single employee of an american company was convicted of stealing intellectual property reportedly worth 400 million dollars.
it's been estimated that last year alone cyber criminals stole intellectual property from businesses worldwide worth up to 1 trillion dollars.
in short, america's economic prosperity in the 21st century will depend on cybersecurity.
and this is also a matter of public safety and national security.
we count on computer networks to deliver our oil and gas, our power and our water.
we rely on them for public transportation and air traffic control.
yet we know that cyber intruders have probed our electrical grid and that in other countries cyber attacks have plunged entire cities into darkness.
our technological advantage is a key to america's military dominance.
but our defense and military networks are under constant attack.
al qaeda and other terrorist groups have spoken of their desire to unleash a cyber attack on our country -- attacks that are harder to detect and harder to defend against.
indeed, in today's world, acts of terror could come not only from a few extremists in suicide vests but from a few key strokes on the computer -- a weapon of mass disruption.
in one of the most serious cyber incidents to date against our military networks, several thousand computers were infected last year by malicious software -- malware.
and while no sensitive information was compromised, our troops and defense personnel had to give up those external memory devices -- thumb drives -- changing the way they used their computers every day.
and last year we had a glimpse of the future face of war.
as russian tanks rolled into georgia, cyber attacks crippled georgian government websites.
the terrorists that sowed so much death and destruction in mumbai relied not only on guns and grenades but also on gps and phones using voice-over-the-internet.
for all these reasons, it's now clear this cyber threat is one of the most serious economic and national security challenges we face as a nation.
it's also clear that we're not as prepared as we should be, as a government or as a country.
in recent years, some progress has been made at the federal level.
but just as we failed in the past to invest in our physical infrastructure -- our roads, our bridges and rails -- we've failed to invest in the security of our digital infrastructure.
no single official oversees cybersecurity policy across the federal government, and no single agency has the responsibility or authority to match the scope and scale of the challenge.
indeed, when it comes to cybersecurity, federal agencies have overlapping missions and don't coordinate and communicate nearly as well as they should -- with each other or with the private sector.
we saw this in the disorganized response to conficker, the internet worm that in recent months has infected millions of computers around the world.
this status quo is no longer acceptable --
not when there's so much at stake.
we can and we must do better.
and that's why shortly after taking office i directed my national security council and homeland security council to conduct a top-to-bottom review of the federal government's efforts to defend our information and communications infrastructure and to recommend the best way to ensure that these networks are able to secure our networks as well as our prosperity.
our review was open and transparent.
i want to acknowledge, melissa hathaway -- who is here -- who is the acting senior director for cyberspace on our national security council, who led the review team, as well as the center for strategic and international studies bipartisan commission on cybersecurity, and all who were part of our 60-day review team.
they listened to a wide variety of groups, many of which are represented here today
and i want to thank for their input: industry and academia, civil liberties and private
-- privacy advocates.
we listened to every level and branch of government -- from local to state to federal, civilian, military, homeland as well as intelligence, congress and international partners, as well.
i consulted with my national security teams, my homeland security teams, and my economic advisors.
today i'm releasing a report on our review, and can announce that my administration will pursue a new comprehensive approach to securing america's digital infrastructure.
this new approach starts at the top, with this commitment from me: from now on, our digital infrastructure -- the networks and computers we depend on every day -- will be treated as they should be: as a strategic national asset.
protecting this infrastructure will be a national security priority.
we will ensure that these networks are secure, trustworthy and resilient.
we will deter, prevent, detect, and defend against attacks and recover quickly from any disruptions or damage.
to give these efforts the high-level focus and attention they deserve -- and as part of the new, single national security staff announced this week -- i'm creating a new office here at the white house that will be led by the cybersecurity coordinator.
because of the critical importance of this work, i will personally select this official.
i'll depend on this official in all matters relating to cybersecurity, and this official will have my full support and regular access to me as we confront these challenges.
today, i want to focus on the important responsibilities this office will fulfill: orchestrating and integrating all cybersecurity policies for the government; working closely with the office of management and budget to ensure agency budgets reflect those priorities; and, in the event of major cyber incident or attack, coordinating our response.
to ensure that federal cyber policies enhance our security and our prosperity, my cybersecurity coordinator will be a member of the national security staff as well as the staff of my national economic council.
to ensure that policies keep faith with our fundamental values, this office will also include an official with a portfolio specifically dedicated to safeguarding the privacy and civil liberties of the american people.
there's much work to be done, and the report we're releasing today outlines a range of actions that we will pursue in five key areas.
first, working in partnership with the communities represented here today, we will develop a new comprehensive strategy to secure america's information and communications networks.
to ensure a coordinated approach across government, my cybersecurity coordinator will work closely with my chief technology officer, aneesh chopra, and my chief information officer, vivek kundra.
to ensure accountability in federal agencies, cybersecurity will be designated as one of my key management priorities.
clear milestones and performances metrics will measure progress.
and as we develop our strategy, we will be open and transparent, which is why you'll find today's report and a wealth of related information on our web site, www.whitehouse.gov.
second, we will work with all the key players -- including state and local governments and the private sector -- to ensure an organized and unified response to future cyber incidents.
given the enormous damage that can be caused by even a single cyber attack, ad hoc responses will not do.
nor is it sufficient to simply strengthen our defenses after incidents or attacks occur.
just as we do for natural disasters, we have to have plans and resources in place beforehand -- sharing information, issuing warnings and ensuring a coordinated response.
third, we will strengthen the public/private partnerships that are critical to this endeavor.
the vast majority of our critical information infrastructure in the united states is owned and operated by the private sector.
so let me be very clear: my administration will not dictate security standards for private companies.
on the contrary, we will collaborate with industry to find technology solutions that ensure our security and promote prosperity.
fourth, we will continue to invest in the cutting-edge research and development necessary for the innovation and discovery we need to meet the digital challenges of our time.
and that's why my administration is making major investments in our information infrastructure: laying broadband lines to every corner of america; building a smart electric grid to deliver energy more efficiently; pursuing a next generation of air traffic control systems; and moving to electronic health records, with privacy protections, to reduce costs and save lives.
and finally, we will begin a national campaign to promote cybersecurity awareness and digital literacy from our boardrooms to our classrooms, and to build a digital workforce for the 21st century.
and that's why we're making a new commitment to education in math and science, and historic investments in science and research and development.
because it's not enough for our children and students to master today's technologies -- social networking and e-mailing and texting and blogging -- we need them to pioneer the technologies that will allow us to work effectively through these new media and allow us to prosper in the future.
so these are the things we will do.
let me also be clear about what we will not do.
our pursuit of cybersecurity will not -- i repeat, will not include -- monitoring private sector networks or internet traffic.
we will preserve and protect the personal privacy and civil liberties that we cherish as americans.
indeed, i remain firmly committed to net neutrality
so we can keep the internet as it should be -- open and free.
the task i have described will not be easy.
some 1.5 billion people around the world are already online, and more are logging on every day.
groups and governments are sharpening their cyber capabilities.
protecting our prosperity and security in this globalized world is going to be a long, difficult struggle demanding patience and persistence over many years.
but we need to remember:
we're only at the beginning.
the epochs of history are long -- the agricultural revolution; the industrial revolution.
by comparison, our information age is still in its infancy.
we're only at web 2.0.
now our virtual world is going viral.
and we've only just begun to explore the next generation of technologies that will transform our lives in ways we can't even begin to imagine.
so a new world awaits -- a world of greater security and greater potential prosperity
-- if we reach for it, if we lead.
so long as i'm president of the united states, we will do just that.
and the united states -- the nation that invented the internet, that launched an information revolution, that transformed the world -- will do what we did in the 20th century and lead once more in the 21st.
thank you very much, everybody.
thank you.
good morning, everybody.
please be seated.
thank you all for being here.
let me just acknowledge the presence of some of my outstanding cabinet members and advisors.
we've got our secretary of state, hillary clinton.
we have our cia director leon panetta.
we have our secretary of defense william gates; secretary napolitano of department of homeland security; attorney general eric holder; my national security advisor jim jones.
and i want to especially thank our acting archivist of the united states, adrienne thomas.
i also want to acknowledge several members of the house who have great interest in intelligence matters.
i want to thank congressman reyes, congressman hoekstra, congressman king, as well as congressman thompson, for being here today.
thank you so much.
these are extraordinary times for our country.
we're confronting a historic economic crisis.
we're fighting two wars.
we face a range of challenges that will define the way that americans will live in the 21st century.
so there's no shortage of work to be done, or responsibilities to bear.
and we've begun to make progress.
just this week, we've taken steps to protect american consumers and homeowners, and to reform our system of government contracting so that we better protect our people while spending our money more wisely.
the -- it's a good bill.
the engines of our economy are slowly beginning to turn, and we're working towards historic reform on health care and on energy.
i want to say to the members of congress
, i welcome all the extraordinary work that has been done over these last four months on these and other issues.
in the midst of all these challenges, however, my single most important responsibility as president is to keep the american people safe.
it's the first thing that i think about when i wake up in the morning.
it's the last thing that i think about when i go to sleep at night.
and this responsibility is only magnified in an era when an extremist ideology threatens our people, and technology gives a handful of terrorists the potential to do us great harm.
we are less than eight years removed from the deadliest attack on american soil in our history.
we know that al qaeda is actively planning to attack us again.
we know that this threat will be with us for a long time, and that we must use all elements of our power to defeat it.
already, we've taken several steps to achieve that goal.
for the first time since 2002, we're providing the necessary resources and strategic direction to take the fight to the extremists who attacked us on 9/11 in afghanistan and pakistan.
we're investing in the 21st century military and intelligence capabilities that will allow us to stay one step ahead of a nimble enemy.
we have re-energized a global non-proliferation regime to deny the world's most dangerous people access to the world's deadliest weapons.
and we've launched an effort to secure all loose nuclear materials within four years.
we're better protecting our border, and increasing our preparedness for any future attack or natural disaster.
we're building new partnerships around the world to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al qaeda and its affiliates.
and we have renewed american diplomacy so that we once again have the strength and standing to truly lead the world.
these steps are all critical to keeping america secure.
but i believe with every fiber of my being that in the long run we also cannot keep this country safe unless we enlist the power of our most fundamental values.
the documents that we hold in this very hall -- the declaration of independence, the constitution, the bill of rights -- these are not simply words written into aging parchment.
they are the foundation of liberty and justice in this country, and a light that shines for all who seek freedom, fairness, equality, and dignity around the world.
i stand here today as someone whose own life was made possible by these documents.
my father came to these shores in search of the promise that they offered.
my mother made me rise before dawn to learn their truths when i lived as a child in a foreign land.
my own american journey was paved by generations of citizens who gave meaning to those simple words -- "to form a more perfect union.
"
i've studied the constitution as a student, i've taught it as a teacher, i've been bound by it as a lawyer and a legislator.
i took an oath to preserve, protect, and defend the constitution as commander-in-chief, and as a citizen, i know that we must never, ever, turn our back on its enduring principles for expedience sake.
i make this claim not simply as a matter of idealism.
we uphold our most cherished values not only because doing so is right, but because it strengthens our country and it keeps us safe.
time and again, our values have been our best national security asset -- in war and peace; in times of ease and in eras of upheaval.
fidelity to our values is the reason why the united states of america grew from a small string of colonies under the writ of an empire to the strongest nation in the world.
it's the reason why enemy soldiers have surrendered to us in battle, knowing they'd receive better treatment from america's armed forces than from their own government.
it's the reason why america has benefitted from strong alliances that amplified our power, and drawn a sharp, moral contrast with our adversaries.
it's the reason why we've been able to overpower the iron fist of fascism and outlast the iron curtain of communism, and enlist free nations and free peoples everywhere in the common cause and common effort of liberty.
from europe to the pacific, we've been the nation that has shut down torture chambers and replaced tyranny with the rule of law.
that is who we are.
and where terrorists offer only the injustice of disorder and destruction, america must demonstrate that our values and our institutions are more resilient than a hateful ideology.
after 9/11, we knew that we had entered a new era -- that enemies who did not abide by any law of war would present new challenges to our application of the law; that our government would need new tools to protect the american people, and that these tools would have to allow us to prevent attacks instead of simply prosecuting those who try to carry them out.
unfortunately, faced with an uncertain threat, our government made a series of hasty decisions.
i believe that many of these decisions were motivated by a sincere desire to protect the american people.
but i also believe that all too often our government made decisions based on fear rather than foresight; that all too often our government trimmed facts and evidence to fit ideological predispositions.
instead of strategically applying our power and our principles, too often we set those principles aside as luxuries that we could no longer afford.
and during this season of fear, too many of us -- democrats and republicans, politicians, journalists, and citizens -- fell silent.
in other words, we went off course.
and this is not my assessment alone.
it was an assessment that was shared by the american people who nominated candidates for president from both major parties who, despite our many differences, called for a new approach -- one that rejected torture and one that recognized the imperative of closing the prison at guantanamo bay.
now let me be clear:  we are indeed at war with al qaeda and its affiliates.
we do need to update our institutions to deal with this threat.
but we must do so with an abiding confidence in the rule of law and due process; in checks and balances and accountability.
for reasons that i will explain, the decisions that were made over the last eight years established an ad hoc legal approach for fighting terrorism that was neither effective nor sustainable -- a framework that failed to rely on our legal traditions and time-tested institutions, and that failed to use our values as a compass.
and that's why i took several steps upon taking office to better protect the american people.
first, i banned the use of so-called enhanced interrogation techniques by the united states of america.
i know some have argued that brutal methods like waterboarding were necessary to keep us safe.
i could not disagree more.
as commander-in-chief, i see the intelligence.
i bear the responsibility for keeping this country safe.
and i categorically reject the assertion that these are the most effective means of interrogation.
what's more, they undermine the rule of law.
they alienate us in the world.
they serve as a recruitment tool for terrorists, and increase the will of our enemies to fight us, while decreasing the will of others to work with america.
they risk the lives of our troops by making it less likely that others will surrender to them in battle, and more likely that americans will be mistreated if they are captured.
in short, they did not advance our war and counterterrorism efforts -- they undermined them, and that is why i ended them once and for all.
now, i should add, the arguments against these techniques did not originate from my administration.
as senator mccain once said, torture "serves as a great propaganda tool for those who recruit people to fight against us."  and even under president bush, there was recognition among members of his own administration -- including a secretary of state, other senior officials, and many in the military and intelligence community -- that those who argued for these tactics were on the wrong side of the debate, and the wrong side of history.
that's why we must leave these methods where they belong -- in the past.
they are not who we are, and they are not america.
the second decision that i made was to order the closing of the prison camp at guantanamo bay.
for over seven years, we have detained hundreds of people at guantanamo.
during that time, the system of military commissions that were in place at guantanamo succeeded in convicting a grand total of three suspected terrorists.
let me repeat that:  three convictions in over seven years.
instead of bringing terrorists to justice, efforts at prosecution met setback after setback, cases lingered on, and in 2006 the supreme court invalidated the entire system.
meanwhile, over 525 detainees were released from guantanamo under not my administration, under the previous administration.
let me repeat that:  two-thirds of the detainees were released before i took office and ordered the closure of guantanamo.
there is also no question that guantanamo set back the moral authority that is america's strongest currency in the world.
instead of building a durable framework for the struggle against al qaeda that drew upon our deeply held values and traditions, our government was defending positions that undermined the rule of law.
in fact, part of the rationale for establishing guantanamo in the first place was the misplaced notion that a prison there would be beyond the law -- a proposition that the supreme court soundly rejected.
meanwhile, instead of serving as a tool to counter terrorism, guantanamo became a symbol that helped al qaeda recruit terrorists to its cause.
indeed, the existence of guantanamo likely created more terrorists around the world than it ever detained.
so the record is clear:  rather than keeping us safer, the prison at guantanamo has weakened american national security.
it is a rallying cry for our enemies.
it sets back the willingness of our allies to work with us in fighting an enemy that operates in scores of countries.
by any measure, the costs of keeping it open far exceed the complications involved in closing it.
that's why i argued that it should be closed throughout my campaign, and that is why i ordered it closed within one year.
the third decision that i made was to order a review of all pending cases at guantanamo.
i knew when i ordered guantanamo closed that it would be difficult and complex.
there are 240 people there who have now spent years in legal limbo.
in dealing with this situation, we don't have the luxury of starting from scratch.
we're cleaning up something that is, quite simply, a mess -- a misguided experiment that has left in its wake a flood of legal challenges that my administration is forced to deal with on a constant, almost daily basis, and it consumes the time of government officials whose time should be spent on better protecting our country.
indeed, the legal challenges that have sparked so much debate in recent weeks here in washington would be taking place whether or not i decided to close guantanamo.
for example, the court order to release 17 uighurs -- 17 uighur detainees took place last fall, when george bush was president.
the supreme court that invalidated the system of prosecution at guantanamo in 2006 was overwhelmingly appointed by republican presidents -- not wild-eyed liberals.
in other words, the problem of what to do with guantanamo detainees was not caused by my decision to close the facility; the problem exists because of the decision to open guantanamo in the first place.
now let me be blunt.
there are no neat or easy answers here.
i wish there were.
but i can tell you that the wrong answer is to pretend like this problem will go away if we maintain an unsustainable status quo.
as president, i refuse to allow this problem to fester.
i refuse to pass it on to somebody else.
it is my responsibility to solve the problem.
our security interests will not permit us to delay.
our courts won't allow it.
and neither should our conscience.
now, over the last several weeks, we've seen a return of the politicization of these issues that have characterized the last several years.
i'm an elected official; i understand these problems arouse passions and concerns.
they should.
we're confronting some of the most complicated questions that a democracy can face.
but i have no interest in spending all of our time relitigating the policies of the last eight years.
i'll leave that to others.
i want to solve these problems, and i want to solve them together as americans.
and we will be ill-served by some of the fear-mongering that emerges whenever we discuss this issue.
listening to the recent debate, i've heard words that, frankly, are calculated to scare people rather than educate them; words that have more to do with politics than protecting our country.
so i want to take this opportunity to lay out what we are doing, and how we intend to resolve these outstanding issues.
i will explain how each action that we are taking will help build a framework that protects both the american people and the values that we hold most dear.
and i'll focus on two broad areas:
first, issues relating to guantanamo and our detention policy; but, second, i also want to discuss issues relating to security and transparency.
now, let me begin by disposing of one argument as plainly as i can:
we are not going to release anyone if it would endanger our national security, nor will we release detainees within the united states who endanger the american people.
where demanded by justice and national security, we will seek to transfer some detainees to the same type of facilities in which we hold all manner of dangerous and violent criminals within our borders -- namely, highly secure prisons that ensure the public safety.
as we make these decisions, bear in mind the following face:
nobody has ever escaped from one of our federal, supermax prisons, which hold hundreds of convicted terrorists.
as republican lindsey graham said, the idea that we cannot find a place to securely house 250-plus detainees within the united states is not rational.
we are currently in the process of reviewing each of the detainee cases at guantanamo to determine the appropriate policy for dealing with them.
and as we do so, we are acutely aware that under the last administration, detainees were released and, in some cases, returned to the battlefield.
that's why we are doing away with the poorly planned, haphazard approach that let those detainees go in the past.
instead we are treating these cases with the care and attention that the law requires and that our security demands.
now, going forward, these cases will fall into five distinct categories.
first, whenever feasible, we will try those who have violated american criminal laws in federal courts -- courts provided for by the united states constitution.
some have derided our federal courts as incapable of handling the trials of terrorists.
they are wrong.
our courts and our juries, our citizens, are tough enough to convict terrorists.
the record makes that clear.
ramzi yousef tried to blow up the world trade center.
he was convicted in our courts and is serving a life sentence in u.s. prisons.
zacarias moussaoui has been identified as the 20th 9/11 hijacker.
he was convicted in our courts, and he too is serving a life sentence in prison.
if we can try those terrorists in our courts and hold them in our prisons, then we can do the same with detainees from guantanamo.
recently, we prosecuted and received a guilty plea from a detainee, al-marri, in federal court after years of legal confusion.
we're preparing to transfer another detainee to the southern district court of new york, where he will face trial on charges related to the 1998 bombings of our embassies in kenya and tanzania -- bombings that killed over 200 people.
preventing this detainee from coming to our shores would prevent his trial and conviction.
and after over a decade, it is time to finally see that justice is served, and that is what we intend to do.
the second category of cases involves detainees who violate the laws of war and are therefore best tried through military commissions.
military commissions have a history in the united states dating back to george washington and the revolutionary war.
they are an appropriate venue for trying detainees for violations of the laws of war.
they allow for the protection of sensitive sources and methods of intelligence-gathering; they allow for the safety and security of participants; and for the presentation of evidence gathered from the battlefield that cannot always be effectively presented in federal courts.
now, some have suggested that this represents a reversal on my part.
they should look at the record.
in 2006, i did strongly oppose legislation proposed by the bush administration and passed by the congress because it failed to establish a legitimate legal framework, with the kind of meaningful due process rights for the accused that could stand up on appeal.
i said at that time, however, that i supported the use of military commissions to try detainees, provided there were several reforms, and in fact there were some bipartisan efforts to achieve those reforms.
those are the reforms that we are now making.
instead of using the flawed commissions of the last seven years, my administration is bringing our commissions in line with the rule of law.
we will no longer permit the use of evidence -- as evidence statements that have been obtained using cruel, inhuman, or degrading interrogation methods.
we will no longer place the burden to prove that hearsay is unreliable on the opponent of the hearsay.
and we will give detainees greater latitude in selecting their own counsel, and more protections if they refuse to testify.
these reforms, among others, will make our military commissions a more credible and effective means of administering justice, and i will work with congress and members of both parties, as well as legal authorities across the political spectrum, on legislation to ensure that these commissions are fair, legitimate, and effective.
the third category of detainees includes those who have been ordered released by the courts.
now, let me repeat what i said earlier:  this has nothing to do with my decision to close guantanamo.
it has to do with the rule of law.
the courts have spoken.
they have found that there's no legitimate reason to hold 21 of the people currently held at guantanamo.
nineteen of these findings took place before i was sworn into office.
i cannot ignore these rulings because as president, i too am bound by the law.
the united states is a nation of laws and so we must abide by these rulings.
the fourth category of cases involves detainees who we have determined can be transferred safely to another country.
so far, our review team has approved 50 detainees for transfer.
and my administration is in ongoing discussions with a number of other countries about the transfer of detainees to their soil for detention and rehabilitation.
now, finally, there remains the question of detainees at guantanamo who cannot be prosecuted yet who pose a clear danger to the american people.
and i have to be honest here
-- this is the toughest single issue that we will face.
we're going to exhaust every avenue that we have to prosecute those at guantanamo who pose a danger to our country.
but even when this process is complete, there may be a number of people who cannot be prosecuted for past crimes, in some cases because evidence may be tainted, but who nonetheless pose a threat to the security of the united states.
examples of that threat include people who've received extensive explosives training at al qaeda training camps, or commanded taliban troops in battle, or expressed their allegiance to osama bin laden, or otherwise made it clear that they want to kill americans.
these are people who, in effect, remain at war with the united states.
let me repeat:
i am not going to release individuals who endanger the american people.
al qaeda terrorists and their affiliates are at war with the united states, and those that we capture -- like other prisoners of war -- must be prevented from attacking us again.
having said that, we must recognize that these detention policies cannot be unbounded.
they can't be based simply on what i or the executive branch decide alone.
that's why my administration has begun to reshape the standards that apply to ensure that they are in line with the rule of law.
we must have clear, defensible, and lawful standards for those who fall into this category.
we must have fair procedures so that we don't make mistakes.
we must have a thorough process of periodic review, so that any prolonged detention is carefully evaluated and justified.
i know that creating such a system poses unique challenges.
and other countries have grappled with this question; now, so must we.
but i want to be very clear that our goal is to construct a legitimate legal framework for the remaining guantanamo detainees that cannot be transferred.
our goal is not to avoid a legitimate legal framework.
in our constitutional system, prolonged detention should not be the decision of any one man.
if and when we determine that the united states must hold individuals to keep them from carrying out an act of war, we will do so within a system that involves judicial and congressional oversight.
and so, going forward, my administration will work with congress to develop an appropriate legal regime so that our efforts are consistent with our values and our constitution.
now, as our efforts to close guantanamo move forward, i know that the politics in congress will be difficult.
these are issues that are fodder for 30-second commercials.
you can almost picture the direct mail pieces that emerge from any vote on this issue -- designed to frighten the population.
i get it.
but if we continue to make decisions within a climate of fear, we will make more mistakes.
and if we refuse to deal with these issues today, then i guarantee you that they will be an albatross around our efforts to combat terrorism in the future.
i have confidence that the american people are more interested in doing what is right to protect this country than in political posturing.
i am not the only person in this city who swore an oath to uphold the constitution --
so did each and every member of congress.
and together we have a responsibility to enlist our values in the effort to secure our people, and to leave behind the legacy that makes it easier for future presidents to keep this country safe.
now, let me touch on a second set of issues that relate to security and transparency.
national security requires a delicate balance.
one
the one hand, our democracy depends on transparency.
on the other hand, some information must be protected from public disclosure for the sake of our security -- for instance, the movement of our troops, our intelligence-gathering, or the information we have about a terrorist organization and its affiliates.
in these and other cases, lives are at stake.
now, several weeks ago, as part of an ongoing court case, i released memos issued by the previous administration's office of legal counsel.
i did not do this because i disagreed with the enhanced interrogation techniques that those memos authorized, and i didn't release the documents because i rejected their legal rationales -- although i do on both counts.
i released the memos because the existence of that approach to interrogation was already widely known, the bush administration had acknowledged its existence, and i had already banned those methods.
the argument that somehow by releasing those memos we are providing terrorists with information about how they will be interrogated makes no sense.
we will not be interrogating terrorists using that approach.
that approach is now prohibited.
in short, i released these memos because there was no overriding reason to protect them.
and the ensuing debate has helped the american people better understand how these interrogation methods came to be authorized and used.
on the other hand, i recently opposed the release of certain photographs that were taken of detainees by u.s. personnel between 2002 and 2004.
individuals who violated standards of behavior in these photos have been investigated and they have been held accountable.
there was and is no debate as to whether what is reflected in those photos is wrong.
nothing has been concealed to absolve perpetrators of crimes.
however, it was my judgment -- informed by my national security team -- that releasing these photos would inflame anti-american opinion and allow our enemies to paint u.s. troops with a broad, damning, and inaccurate brush, thereby endangering them in theaters of war.
in short, there is a clear and compelling reason to not release these particular photos.
there are nearly 200,000 americans who are serving in harm's way, and i have a solemn responsibility for their safety as commander-in-chief.
nothing would be gained by the release of these photos that matters more than the lives of our young men and women serving in harm's way.
now, in the press's mind and in some of the public's mind, these two cases are contradictory.
they are not to me.
in each of these cases, i had to strike the right balance between transparency and national security.
and this balance brings with it a precious responsibility.
there's no doubt that the american people have seen this balance tested over the last several years.
in the images from abu ghraib and the brutal interrogation techniques made public long before i was president, the american people learned of actions taken in their name that bear no resemblance to the ideals that generations of americans have fought for.
and whether it was the run-up to the iraq war or the revelation of secret programs, americans often felt like part of the story had been unnecessarily withheld from them.
and that caused suspicion to build up.
and that leads to a thirst for accountability.
i understand that.
i ran for president promising transparency, and i meant what i said.
and that's why, whenever possible, my administration will make all information available to the american people so that they can make informed judgments and hold us accountable.
but i have never argued --
and i never will -- that our most sensitive national security matters should simply be an open book.
i will never abandon -- and will vigorously defend -- the necessity of classification to defend our troops at war, to protect sources and methods, and to safeguard confidential actions that keep the american people safe.
here's the difference though:  whenever we cannot release certain information to the public for valid national security reasons, i will insist that there is oversight of my actions -- by congress or by the courts.
we're currently launching a review of current policies by all those agencies responsible for the classification of documents to determine where reforms are possible, and to assure that the other branches of government will be in a position to review executive branch decisions on these matters.
because in our system of checks and balances, someone must always watch over the watchers -- especially when it comes to sensitive administration -- information.
now, along these same lines, my administration is also confronting challenges to what is known as the "state secrets" privilege.
this is a doctrine that allows the government to challenge legal cases involving secret programs.
it's been used by many past presidents -- republican and democrat -- for many decades.
and while this principle is absolutely necessary in some circumstances to protect national security, i am concerned that it has been over-used.
it is also currently the subject of a wide range of lawsuits.
so let me lay out some principles here.
we must not protect information merely because it reveals the violation of a law or embarrassment to the government.
and that's why my administration is nearing completion of a thorough review of this practice.
and we plan to embrace several principles for reform.
we will apply a stricter legal test to material that can be protected under the state secrets privilege.
we will not assert the privilege in court without first following our own formal process, including review by a justice department committee and the personal approval of the attorney general.
and each year we will voluntarily report to congress when we have invoked the privilege and why because, as i said before, there must be proper oversight over our actions.
on all these matters related to the disclosure of sensitive information, i wish i could say that there was some simple formula out there to be had.
there is not.
these often involve tough calls, involve competing concerns, and they require a surgical approach.
but the common thread that runs through all of my decisions is simple:
we will safeguard what we must to protect the american people, but we will also ensure the accountability and oversight that is the hallmark of our constitutional system.
i will never hide the truth because it's uncomfortable.
i will deal with congress and the courts as co-equal branches of government.
i will tell the american people what i know and don't know, and when i release something publicly or keep something secret, i will tell you why.
now, in all the areas that i've discussed today, the policies that i've proposed represent a new direction from the last eight years.
to protect the american people and our values, we've banned enhanced interrogation techniques.
we are closing the prison at guantanamo.
we are reforming military commissions, and we will pursue a new legal regime to detain terrorists.
we are declassifying more information and embracing more oversight of our actions, and we're narrowing our use of the state secrets privilege.
these are dramatic changes that will put our approach to national security on a surer, safer, and more sustainable footing.
their implementation will take time, but they will get done.
there's a core principle that we will apply to all of our actions.
even as we clean up the mess at guantanamo, we will constantly reevaluate our approach, subject our decisions to review from other branches of government, as well as the public.
we seek the strongest and most sustainable legal framework for addressing these issues in the long term -- not to serve immediate politics, but to do what's right over the long term.
by doing that we can leave behind a legacy that outlasts my administration, my presidency, that endures for the next president and the president after that -- a legacy that protects the american people and enjoys a broad legitimacy at home and abroad.
now, this is what i mean when i say that we need to focus on the future.
i recognize that many still have a strong desire to focus on the past.
when it comes to actions of the last eight years, passions are high.
some americans are angry; others want to re-fight debates that have been settled, in some cases debates that they have lost.
i know that these debates lead directly, in some cases, to a call for a fuller accounting, perhaps through an independent commission.
i've opposed the creation of such a commission because i believe that our existing democratic institutions are strong enough to deliver accountability.
the congress can review abuses of our values, and there are ongoing inquiries by the congress into matters like enhanced interrogation techniques.
the department of justice and our courts can work through and punish any violations of our laws or miscarriages of justice.
it's no secret there is a tendency in washington to spend our time pointing fingers at one another.
and it's no secret that our media culture feeds the impulse that lead to a good fight and good copy.
but nothing will contribute more than that than a extended relitigation of the last eight years.
already, we've seen how that kind of effort only leads those in washington to different sides to laying blame.
it can distract us from focusing our time, our efforts, and our politics on the challenges of the future.
we see that, above all, in the recent debate -- how the recent debate has obscured the truth and sends people into opposite and absolutist ends.
on the one side of the spectrum, there are those who make little allowance for the unique challenges posed by terrorism, and would almost never put national security over transparency.
and on the other end of the spectrum, there are those who embrace a view that can be summarized in two words:  "anything goes.
"
their arguments suggest that the ends of fighting terrorism can be used to justify any means, and that the president should have blanket authority to do whatever he wants -- provided it is a president with whom they agree.
both sides may be sincere in their views, but neither side is right.
the american people are not absolutist, and they don't elect us to impose a rigid ideology on our problems.
they know that we need not sacrifice our security for our values, nor sacrifice our values for our security, so long as we approach difficult questions with honesty and care and a dose of common sense.
that, after all, is the unique genius of america.
that's the challenge laid down by our constitution.
that has been the source of our strength through the ages.
that's what makes the united states of america different as a nation.
i can stand here today, as president of the united states, and say without exception or equivocation that we do not torture, and that we will vigorously protect our people while forging a strong and durable framework that allows us to fight terrorism while abiding by the rule of law.
make no mistake:  if we fail to turn the page on the approach that was taken over the past several years, then i will not be able to say that as president.
and if we cannot stand for our core values, then we are not keeping faith with the documents that are enshrined in this hall.
the framers who drafted the constitution could not have foreseen the challenges that have unfolded over the last 222 years.
but our constitution has endured through secession and civil rights, through world war and cold war, because it provides a foundation of principles that can be applied pragmatically; it provides a compass that can help us find our way.
it hasn't always been easy.
we are an imperfect people.
every now
and then, there are those who think that america's safety and success requires us to walk away from the sacred principles enshrined in this building.
and we hear such voices today.
but over the long haul the american people have resisted that temptation.
and though we've made our share of mistakes, required some course corrections, ultimately we have held fast to the principles that have been the source of our strength and a beacon to the world.
now this generation faces a great test in the specter of terrorism.
and unlike the civil war or world war ii, we can't count on a surrender ceremony to bring this journey to an end.
right now, in distant training camps and in crowded cities, there are people plotting to take american lives.
that will be the case a year from now, five years from now, and -- in all probability -- 10 years from now.
neither i nor anyone can stand here today and say that there will not be another terrorist attack that takes american lives.
but i can say with certainty that my administration -- along with our extraordinary troops and the patriotic men and women who defend our national security -- will do everything in our power to keep the american people safe.
and i do know with certainty that we can defeat al qaeda.
because the terrorists can only succeed if they swell their ranks and alienate america from our allies, and they will never be able to do that if we stay true to who we are, if we forge tough and durable approaches to fighting terrorism that are anchored in our timeless ideals.
this must be our common purpose.
i ran for president because i believe that we cannot solve the challenges of our time unless we solve them together.
we will not be safe if we see national security as a wedge that divides america -- it can and must be a cause that unites us as one people and as one nation.
we've done so before in times that were more perilous than ours.
we will do so once again.
thank you, god bless you, and god bless the united states of america.
president obama: thank you very much.
thank you, notre dame.
thank you.
thank you.
please, have a seat.
thank you...
well first of all, congratulations, class of 2009.
congratulations to all the parents, the cousins, the aunts, the uncles --
the -- all the people who helped to bring you to the point that you are here today.
thank you so much to father jenkins for that extraordinary introduction, even though you said what i want to say much more elegantly.
you are doing an extraordinary job as president of this extraordinary institution, and your continued and courageous and contagious commitment to honest, thoughtful dialogue is an inspiration to us all.
so, good afternoon, to father hesburgh, to notre dame trustees, to faculty, to family.
i am honored to be here today.
and...i am grateful to all of you for allowing me to be a part of your graduation.
and i also want to thank you for the honorary degree that i received.
i know it has not been without controversy.
i don't know if you're aware of this, but these honorary degrees are apparently pretty hard to come by.
so far i'm only 1 for 2 as president.
father...
hesburgh is 150 for 150.
i guess that's better.
so, father ted after the ceremony maybe you can give me some pointers to boost my average.
i also want to congratulate the class of 2009 for all your accomplishments.
and since --

[audience member interrupts with pro-life slogans]
president obama:
and since -- this is notre dame, i mean --
that's...all right.
and since -- 

[audience chants "we are nd!
we are nd!"]
president obama
: we're fine, everybody.
we're -- we're following brennan's adage that we don't do things easily.
we want to --
we're --
we're not going to shy away from things that are uncomfortable sometimes.
now, since -- since this is notre dame i think we should talk not only about your accomplishments in the classroom, but also in the competitive arena.
no, don't worry, i'm not going to talk about that.
we all know about this university's proud and storied football team, but i also hear that notre dame holds the largest outdoor 5-on-5 basketball tournament in the world -- "bookstore basketball."
now this excites me.
i want to congratulate the winners of this year's tournament, a team by the name of "hallelujah holla back.
" congratulations.
well done.
though i have to say, i'm personally disappointed that the "barack o'ballers" did not pull it out this year.
so next year, if you need a 6'2" forward with a decent jumper, you know where i live.
now, every one of you should be proud of what you've achieved at this institution.
one hundred and sixty-three classes of notre dame graduates have sat where you sit today.
some were here during years that simply rolled into the next without much notice or fanfare -- periods of relative peace and prosperity that required little by way of sacrifice or struggle.
you, however, are not getting off that easy.
you have a different deal.
your class has come of age at a moment of great consequence for our nation and for the world -- a rare inflection point in history where the size and scope of the challenges before us require that we remake our world to renew its promise, that we align our deepest values and commitments to the demands of a new age.
it's a privilege and a responsibility afforded to few generations -- and a task that you're now called to fulfill.
this generation, your generation is the one that must find a path back to prosperity and decide how we respond to a global economy that left millions behind even before the most recent crisis hit -- an economy where greed and short-term thinking were too often rewarded at the expense of fairness, and diligence, and an honest day's work.
your generation -- your generation must decide how to save god's creation from a changing climate that threatens to destroy it.
your generation must seek peace at a time when there are those who will stop at nothing to do us harm, and when weapons in the hands of a few can destroy the many.
and we must find a way to reconcile our ever-shrinking world with its ever-growing diversity -- diversity of thought, diversity of culture, and diversity of belief.
in short, we must find a way to live together as one human family.
and -- and it's this last challenge that i'd like to talk about today, despite the fact that father john stole all my best lines.
for the major threats we face in the 21st century -- whether it's global recession or violent extremism, the spread of nuclear weapons or pandemic disease -- these things do not discriminate.
they do not recognize borders.
they do not see color.
they do not target specific ethnic groups.
moreover, no one person, or religion, or nation can meet these challenges alone.
our very survival has never required greater cooperation and greater understanding among all people from all places than at this moment in history.
unfortunately, finding that common ground -- recognizing that our fates are tied up, as dr. king said, in a "single garment of destiny" -- is not easy.
and part of the problem, of course, lies in the imperfections of man -- our selfishness, our pride, our stubbornness, our acquisitiveness, our insecurities, our egos -- all the cruelties large and small that those of us in the christian tradition understand to be rooted in original sin.
we too often seek advantage over others.
we cling to outworn prejudice and fear those who are unfamiliar.
too many of us view life only through the lens of immediate self-interest and crass materialism -- in which the world is necessarily a zero-sum game.
the strong too often dominate the weak, and too many of those with wealth and with power find all manner of justification for their own privilege in the face of poverty and injustice.
and so for all our technology and scientific advances, we see here in this country and around the globe violence and want and strife that would seem sadly familiar to those in ancient times.
we know these things.
and hopefully one of the benefits of the wonderful education that you have received here at notre dame is that you've had time to consider these wrongs in the world
, perhaps recognized impulses in yourself that you want to leave behind.
you've grown determined -- each in your own way -- to right them.
and yet one of the vexing things for those of us interested in promoting greater understanding and cooperation among people is the discovery that even bringing together persons of good will, bringing together men and women of principle and purpose -- even accomplishing that can be difficult.
the soldier and the lawyer may both love this country with equal passion, and yet reach very different conclusions on the specific steps needed to protect us from harm.
the gay activist and the evangelical pastor may both deplore the ravages of hiv/aids, but find themselves unable to bridge the cultural divide that might unite their efforts.
those who speak out against stem cell research may be rooted in an admirable conviction about the sacredness of life, but so are the parents of a child with juvenile diabetes who are convinced that their son's or daughter's hardships might be relieved.
the --
the question, then -- the question, then, is how do we work through these conflicts?
is it possible for us to join hands in common effort?
as citizens of a vibrant and varied democracy, how do we engage in vigorous debate?
how does each of us remain firm in our principles, and fight for what we consider right, without, as father john said, demonizing those with just as strongly held convictions on the other side?
and of course, nowhere do these questions come up more powerfully than on the issue of abortion.
as i considered the controversy surrounding my visit here, i was reminded of an encounter i had during my senate campaign, one that i describe in a book i wrote called the audacity of hope.
in a few days after i won the democratic nomination, i received an e-mail from a doctor who told me that while he voted for me in the illinois primary, he had a serious concern that might prevent him from voting for me in the general election.
he described himself as a christian who was strongly pro-life -- but that was not what was preventing him potentially from voting for me.
what bothered the doctor was an entry that my campaign staff had posted on my website -- an entry that said i would fight, quote, "right-wing ideologues who want to take away a woman's right to choose," unquote.
the doctor said he had assumed i was a reasonable person.
he supported my policy initiatives to help the poor and to lift up our educational system, but that if i truly believed that every pro-life individual was simply an ideologue who wanted to inflict suffering on women, then i was not very reasonable.
he wrote, "i do not ask at this point that you oppose abortion, only that you speak about this issue in fair-minded words."
fair-minded words.
after i read the doctor's letter, i wrote back to him
and i thanked him.
and i didn't change my underlying position, but i did tell my staff to change the words on my website.
and i said a prayer that night that i might extend the same presumption of good faith to others that the doctor had extended to me; because when we do that -- when we open up our hearts and our minds to those who may not think precisely like we do or believe precisely what we believe -- that's when we discover at least the possibility of common ground.
that's when we begin to say, "maybe we won't agree on abortion, but we can still agree that this heart-wrenching decision for any woman is not made casually, and it has both moral and spiritual dimensions.
so let us work together to reduce the number of women seeking abortions.
let's reduce unintended pregnancies.
let's make adoption more available.
let's -- let's provide care and support for women who do carry their children to term.
let's honor the conscience of those who disagree with abortion, and draft a sensible conscience clause, and make sure that all of our health care policies are grounded not only in sound science, but also in clear ethics, as well as respect for the equality of women.
those are things we can do.
now, understand -- understand, class of 2009
, i do not suggest that the debate surrounding abortion can or should go away, because no matter how much we may want to fudge it -- indeed, while we know that the views of most americans on the subject are complex and even contradictory -- the fact is that at some level, the views of the two camps are irreconcilable.
each side will continue to make its case to the public with passion and conviction.
but surely we can do so without reducing those with differing views to caricature.
open hearts.
open minds.
fair-minded words.
it's a way of life that has always been the notre dame tradition.
you know, father -- father hesburgh has long spoken of this institution as both a -- a lighthouse and a crossroads, a lighthouse that stands apart, shining with the wisdom of the catholic tradition, while the crossroads is where "differences of culture and religion and conviction can co-exist with friendship, civility, hospitality, and especially love."
and i want to join him and father john in saying how inspired i am by the maturity and responsibility with which this class has approached the debate surrounding today's ceremony.
you are an example of what notre dame is about.
now, this tradition of cooperation and understanding is one that i learned in my own life many years ago -- also with the help of the catholic church.
you see, i was not raised in a particularly religious household, but my mother instilled in me a sense of service and empathy that eventually led me to become a community organizer after i graduated college.
and a group of catholic churches in chicago helped fund an organization known as the "developing communities project," and we worked to lift up south side neighborhoods that had been devastated when the local steel plant closed.
and it was quite an eclectic crew -- catholic and protestant churches, jewish and african american organizers, working-class black, white, and hispanic residents -- all of us with different experiences, all of us with different beliefs; but all of us learned to work side by side because all of us saw in these neighborhoods other human beings who needed our help to find jobs and improve schools.
we were bound together in the service of others.
and something else happened during the time i spent in these neighborhoods, perhaps because the church folks i worked with were so welcoming and understanding; perhaps because they invited me to their services and sang with me from their hymnals; perhaps because i was really broke and they fed me; perhaps because i witnessed all of the good works their faith inspired them to perform, i found myself drawn not just to the work with the church; i was drawn to be in the church.
it was through this service that i was brought to christ.
and at the time, cardinal joseph bernardin was the archbishop of chicago.
and for those of you -- for those of you too young to have known him or known of him, he was a kind and good and wise man; a saintly man.
i can still remember him speaking at one of the first organizing meetings i attended on the south side.
he stood as both a lighthouse and a crossroads -- unafraid to speak his mind on moral issues ranging from poverty and aids and abortion to the death penalty and nuclear war.
and yet, he was congenial and gentle in his persuasion, always trying to bring people together, always trying to find common ground.
and just before he died, a reporter asked cardinal bernardin about this approach to his ministry.
and he said, "you can't really get on with preaching the gospel until you've touched hearts and minds."
my heart and mind were touched by him.
they were touched by the words and deeds of the men and women i worked alongside in parishes across chicago.
and i'd like to think that we touched the hearts and minds of the neighborhood families whose lives we helped change.
for this, i believe, is our highest calling.
now, you, class of 2009, are about to enter the next phase of your life at a time of great uncertainty.
you'll be called to help restore a free market that's also fair to all who are willing to work.
you'll be called to seek new sources of energy that can save our planet; to give future generations the same chance that you had to receive an extraordinary education.
and whether as a person drawn to public service, or simply someone who insists on being an active citizen, you will be exposed to more opinions and ideas broadcast through more means of communication than ever existed before.
you'll hear talking heads scream on cable; and you'll read blogs that claim definitive knowledge; and you will watch politicians pretend they know what they're talking about.
occasionally, you may have the great fortune of actually seeing important issues debated by people who do know what they're talking about -- by well-intentioned people with brilliant minds and mastery of the facts.
in fact, i suspect that some of you will be among those brightest stars.
and in this world of competing claims about what is right and what is true, have confidence in the values with which you've been raised and educated.
be unafraid to speak your mind when those values are at stake.
hold firm to your faith and allow it to guide you on your journey.
in other words, stand as a lighthouse.
but remember, too, that you can be a crossroads.
remember, too, that the ultimate irony of faith is that it necessarily admits doubt.
it's the belief in things not seen.
it's beyond our capacity as human beings to know with certainty what god has planned for us or what he asks of us.
and those of us who believe must trust that his wisdom is greater than our own.
and this doubt should not push us away our faith.
but it should humble us.
it should temper our passions, cause us to be wary of too much self-righteousness.
it should compel us to remain open and curious and eager to continue the spiritual and moral debate that began for so many of you within the walls of notre dame.
and within our vast democracy, this doubt should remind us even as we cling to our faith to persuade through reason, through an appeal, whenever we can, to universal rather than parochial principles, and most of all through an abiding example of good works and charity and kindness and service that moves hearts and minds.
for if there is one law that we can be most certain of, it is the law that binds people of all faiths and no faith together.
it's no coincidence that it exists in christianity and judaism, in islam and hinduism, in buddhism and humanism.
it is, of course, the golden rule -- the call to treat one another as we wish to be treated.
the call to love.
the call to serve.
to do what we can to make a difference in the lives of those with whom we share the same brief moment on this earth.
so many of you at notre dame -- by the last count, upwards of 80 percent -- have lived this law of love through the service you've performed at schools and hospitals, international relief agencies and local charities.
brennan is just one example of what your class has accomplished.
that's incredibly impressive, a powerful testament to this institution.
and now -- now you must carry the tradition forward.
make it a way of life.
because when you serve, it doesn't just improve your community, it makes you a part of your community.
it breaks down walls.
it fosters cooperation.
and when that happens -- when -- when people set aside their differences, even for a moment, to work in common effort toward a common goal; when they struggle together, and sacrifice together, and learn from one another -- then all things are possible.
after all, i stand here today, as president and as an african american, on the 55th anniversary of the day that the supreme court handed down the decision in brown versus board of education.
now, brown was of course the first major step in dismantling the "separate but equal" doctrine.
but it would take a number of years and a nationwide movement to fully realize the dream of civil rights for all of god's children.
there were freedom rides and lunch counters and billy clubs, and there was also a civil rights commission appointed by president eisenhower.
it was the 12 resolutions recommended by this commission that would ultimately become law in the civil rights act of 1964.
there were six members of this commission.
it included five whites and one african american, democrats and republicans, two southern governors, the dean of a southern law school, a midwestern university president, and your own father ted hesburgh, president of notre dame.
so they worked for two years, and at times president eisenhower had to intervene personally since no hotel or restaurant in the south would serve the black and white members of the commission together.
and finally when they reached an impasse in louisiana, father ted flew them all to notre dame's retreat in land o'lakes, wisconsin -- where they eventually -- where they eventually overcame their differences and hammered out a final deal.
and years later, president eisenhower asked father ted how on earth he was able to broker an agreement between men of such different backgrounds and beliefs.
and father ted simply said that during their first dinner in wisconsin they discovered they were all fishermen.
and so he quickly readied a boat for a twilight trip out on the lake.
they fished, and they talked, and they changed the course of history.
i will not pretend that the challenges we face will be easy, or that the answers will come quickly, or that all our differences and divisions will fade happily away -- because life is not that simple.
it never has been.
but as you leave here today, remember the lessons of cardinal bernardin, of father hesburgh, of movements for change both large and small.
remember that each of us, endowed with the dignity possessed by all children of god, has the grace to recognize ourselves in one another; to understand that we all seek the same love of family, the same fulfillment of a life well lived.
remember that in the end, in some way we are all fishermen.
if nothing else, that knowledge should give us faith
that through our collective labor, and god's providence, and our willingness to shoulder each other's burdens, america will continue on its precious journey towards that more perfect union.
congratulations, class of 2009.
may god bless you, and may god bless the united states of america.
thank you.
thank you, everybody.
good evening.
you know, i had an entire speech prepared for this wonderful occasion, but now that i'm here i think i'm going to try something a little different.
tonight i want to speak from the heart.
i'm going to speak off the cuff.
[teleprompters rise.]
good evening.
pause for laughter.
wait a minute, this may not be working as well as
i
-- let me try that again.
good evening, everybody.
i would like to welcome you all to the 10-day anniversary of my first 100 days.
i am barack obama.
most of you covered me.
all of you voted for me.
apologies to the fox table.
they're -- where are they?
i have to confess i really did not want to be here tonight, but i knew i had to come --
just one more problem that i've inherited from george w. bush.
but now that i'm here, it's great to be here.
it's great to see all of you.
michelle obama is here, the first lady of the united states.
hasn't she been an outstanding first lady?
she's even begun to bridge the differences that have divided us for so long, because no matter which party you belong to we
can all agree that michelle has the right to bare arms.
now sasha and malia aren't here tonight because they're grounded.
you can't just take air force one on a joy ride to manhattan.
i don't care whose kids you are.
we've been setting some ground rules here.
they're starting to get a little carried away.
now, speaking -- when i think about children obviously i think about michelle
and it reminds me that tomorrow is mother's day.
happy mother's day to all the mothers in the audience.
i do have to say, though, that this is a tough holiday for rahm emanuel because he's not used to saying the word "day" after "mother.
" that's true.
david axelrod is here.
you know, david and i have been together for a long time.
i can still remember -- i got to sort of -- i tear up a little bit when i think back to that day that i called ax so many years ago and said, you and i can do wonderful things together.
and he said to me the same thing that partners all across america are saying to one another right now
: let's go to iowa and make it official.
michael steele is in the house tonight.
or as he would say, "in the heezy.
"
what's up?
where is michael?
michael, for the last time, the republican party does not qualify for a bailout.
rush limbaugh does not count as a troubled asset, i'm sorry.
dick cheney was supposed to be here
but he is very busy working on his memoirs, tentatively titled, "how to shoot friends and interrogate people.
"
you know, it's been a whirlwind of activity these first hundred days.
we've enacted a major economic recovery package, we passed a budget, we forged a new path in iraq, and no president in history has ever named three commerce secretaries this quickly.
which reminds me, if judd gregg is here, your business cards are ready now.
on top of that, i've also reversed the ban on stem cell research, signed an expansion -- signed an expansion of the children's health insurance.
just last week, car and driver named me auto executive of the year.
something
i'm very proud of.
we've also begun to change the culture in washington.
we've even made the white house a place where people can learn and can grow.
just recently, larry summers asked if he could chair the white house council on women and girls.
and i do appreciate that larry is here tonight because it is seven hours past his bedtime.
gibbs liked that one.
in the last hundred days, we've also grown the democratic party by infusing it with new energy and bringing in fresh, young faces like arlen specter.
now, joe biden rightly deserves a lot of credit for convincing arlen to make the switch, but secretary clinton actually had a lot to do with it too.
one day she just pulled him aside and she said, arlen, you know what i always say -- "if you can't beat them, join them."
which brings me to another thing that's changed in this new, warmer, fuzzier white house, and that's my relationship with hillary.
you know, we had been rivals during the campaign, but these days we could not be closer.
in fact, the second she got back from mexico she pulled into a hug and gave me a big kiss.
told me i'd better get down there myself.
which i really appreciated.
i mean, it was --
it was nice.
and of course we've also begun to change america's image in the world.
we talked about this during this campaign and we're starting to execute.
we've renewed alliances with important partners and friends.
if you look on the screen there, there i am with japanese prime minister taro aso.
there i am with gordon brown.
but as i said during the campaign, we can't just talk to our friends.
as hard as it is, we also have to talk to our enemies, and i've begun to do exactly that.
take a look at the monitor there.
now, let me be clear, just because he handed me a copy of peter pan does not mean that i'm going to read it -- but it's good diplomatic practice to just accept these gifts.
all this change hasn't been easy.
change never is.
so i've cut the tension by bringing a new friend to the white house.
he's warm, he's cuddly, loyal, enthusiastic.
you just have to keep him on a tight leash.
every once in a while he goes charging off in the wrong direction and gets himself into trouble.
but enough about joe biden.
all in all, we're proud of the change we've brought to washington in these first hundred days
but we've got a lot of work left to do, as all of you know.
so i'd like to talk a little bit about what my administration plans to achieve in the next hundred days.
during the second hundred days, we will design, build and open a library dedicated to my first hundred days.
it's going to be big, folks.
in the next hundred days, i will learn to go off the prompter and joe biden will learn to stay on the prompter.
in the next hundred days, our bipartisan outreach will be so successful that even john boehner will consider becoming a democrat.
after all, we have a lot in common.
he is a person of color.
although not a color that appears in the natural world.
what's up, john?
in the next hundred days, i will meet with a leader who rules over millions with an iron fist, who owns the airwaves and uses his power to crush all who would challenge his authority at the ballot box.
it's good to see you, mayor bloomberg.
in the next hundred days, we will housetrain our dog, bo, because the last thing tim geithner needs is someone else treating him like a fire hydrant.
in the next hundred days, i will strongly consider losing my cool.
finally, i believe that my next hundred days will be so successful i will be able to complete them in 72 days.
and on the 73rd day, i will rest.
i just -- i want to end by saying a few words about the men and women in this room whose job it is to inform the public and pursue the truth.
you know, we meet tonight at a moment of extraordinary challenge for this nation and for the world, but it's also a time of real hardship for the field of journalism.
and like so many other businesses in this global age, you've seen sweeping changes and technology and communications that lead to a sense of uncertainty and anxiety about what the future will hold.
across the country, there are extraordinary, hardworking journalists who have lost their jobs in recent days, recent weeks, recent months.
and i know that each newspaper and media outlet is wrestling with how to respond to these changes, and some are struggling simply to stay open.
and it won't be easy.
not every ending will be a happy one.
but it's also true that your ultimate success as an industry is essential to the success of our democracy.
it's what makes this thing work.
you know, thomas jefferson once said that if he had the choice between a government without newspapers, or newspapers without a government, he would not hesitate to choose the latter.
clearly, thomas jefferson never had cable news to contend with -- but his central point remains: a government without newspapers, a government without a tough and vibrant media of all sorts, is not an option for the united states of america.
so i may not
-- i may not agree with everything you write or report.
i may even complain, or more likely gibbs will complain, from time to time about how you do your jobs, but i do so with the knowledge that when you are at your best, then you help me be at my best.
you help all of us who serve at the pleasure of the american people do our jobs better by holding us accountable, by demanding honesty, by preventing us from taking shortcuts and falling into easy political games that people are so desperately weary of.
and that kind of reporting is worth preserving -- not just for your sake, but for the public's.
we count on you to help us make sense of a complex world and tell the stories of our lives the way they happen, and we look for you for truth, even if it's always an approximation, even if --
this is a season of renewal and reinvention.
that is what government must learn to do, that's what businesses must learn to do, and that's what journalism is in the process of doing.
and when i look out at this room and think about the dedicated men and women whose questions i've answered over the last few years, i know that for all the challenges this industry faces, it's not short on talent or creativity or passion or commitment.
it's not short of young people who are eager to break news or the not-so-young who still manage to ask the tough ones time and time again.
these qualities alone will not solve all your problems, but they certainly prove that the problems are worth solving.
and that is a good place as any to begin.
so i offer you my thanks
, i offer you my support, and i look forward to working with you and answering to you and the american people as we seek a more perfect union in the months and years ahead.
thank you very much, everybody.
thank you.
thank you very much.
to sara bloomfield, for the wonderful introduction and the outstanding work she's doing; to fred zeidman; joel geiderman; mr. wiesel -- thank you for your wisdom and your witness; speaker nancy pelosi; senator dick durbin; members of congress; our good friend the ambassador of israel; members of the united states holocaust memorial council; and most importantly, the survivors and rescuers and their families who are here today.
it is a great honor for me to be here, and i'm grateful that i have the opportunity to address you briefly.
we gather today to mourn the loss of so many lives, and celebrate those who saved them; honor those who survived, and contemplate the obligations of the living.
it is the grimmest of ironies that one of the most savage, barbaric acts of evil in history began in one of the most modernized societies of its time, where so many markers of human progress became tools of human depravity: science that can heal used to kill; education that can enlighten used to rationalize away basic moral impulses; the bureaucracy that sustains modern life used as the machinery of mass death -- a ruthless, chillingly efficient system where many were responsible for the killing, but few got actual blood on their hands.
while the uniqueness of the holocaust in scope and in method is truly astounding, the holocaust was driven by many of the same forces that have fueled atrocities throughout history: the scapegoating that leads to hatred and blinds us to our common humanity; the justifications that replace conscience and allow cruelty to spread; the willingness of those who are neither perpetrators nor victims to accept the assigned role of bystander, believing the lie that good people are ever powerless or alone, the fiction that we do not have a choice.
but while we are here today to bear witness to the human capacity to destroy, we are also here to pay tribute to the human impulse to save.
in the moral accounting of the holocaust, as we reckon with numbers like 6 million, as we recall the horror of numbers etched into arms, we also factor in numbers like these: 7,200 -- the number of danish jews ferried to safety, many of whom later returned home to find the neighbors who rescued them had also faithfully tended their homes and businesses and belongings while they were gone.
we remember the number five -- the five righteous men and women who join us today from poland.
we are awed by your acts of courage and conscience.
and your presence today compels each of us to ask ourselves whether we would have done what you did.
we can only hope that the answer is yes.
we also remember the number 5,000 -- the number of jews rescued by the villagers of le chambon, france -- one life saved for each of its 5,000 residents.
not a single jew who came there was turned away, or turned in.
but it was not until decades later that the villagers spoke of what they had done -- and even then, only reluctantly.
the author of a book on the rescue found that those he interviewed were baffled by his interest.
"how could you call us 'good'?
" they said.
"we were doing what had to be done."
that is the question of the righteous -- those who would do extraordinary good at extraordinary risk not for affirmation or acclaim or to advance their own interests, but because it is what must be done.
they remind us that no one is born a savior or a murderer -- these are choices we each have the power to make.
they teach us that no one can make us into bystanders without our consent, and that we are never truly alone --
that if we have the courage to heed that "still, small voice" within us, we can form a minyan for righteousness that can span a village, even a nation.
their legacy is our inheritance.
and the question is, how do we honor and preserve it?
how do we ensure that "never again" isn't an empty slogan, or merely an aspiration, but also a call to action?
i believe we start by doing what we are doing today -- by bearing witness, by fighting the silence that is evil's greatest co-conspirator.
in the face of horrors that defy comprehension, the impulse to silence is understandable.
my own great uncle returned from his service in world war ii in a state of shock, saying little, alone with painful memories that would not leave his head.
he went up into the attic, according to the stories that i've heard, and wouldn't come down for six months.
he was one of the liberators -- someone who at a very tender age had seen the unimaginable.
and so some of the liberators who are here today honor us with their presence -- all of whom we honor for their extraordinary service.
my great uncle was part of the 89th infantry division -- the first americans to reach a nazi concentration camp.
and they liberated ohrdruf, part of buchenwald, where tens of thousands had perished.
the story goes that when the americans marched in, they discovered the starving survivors and the piles of dead bodies.
and general eisenhower made a decision.
he ordered germans from the nearby town to tour the camp, so they could see what had been done in their name.
and he ordered american troops to tour the camp, so they could see the evil they were fighting against.
then he invited congressmen and journalists to bear witness.
and he ordered that photographs and films be made.
some of us have seen those same images, whether in the holocaust museum or when i visited yad vashem, and they never leave you.
eisenhower said that he wanted "to be in a position to give firsthand evidence of these things, if ever, in the future, there develops a tendency to charge these allegations merely to propaganda."
eisenhower understood the danger of silence.
he understood that if no one knew what had happened, that would be yet another atrocity -- and it would be the perpetrators' ultimate triumph.
what eisenhower did to record these crimes for history is what we are doing here today.
that's what elie wiesel and the survivors we honor here do by fighting to make their memories part of our collective memory.
that's what the holocaust museum does every day on our national mall, the place where we display for the world our triumphs and failures and the lessons we've learned from our history.
it's the very opposite of silence.
but we must also remember that bearing witness is not the end of our obligation
-- it's just the beginning.
we know that evil has yet to run its course on earth.
we've seen it in this century in the mass graves and the ashes of villages burned to the ground, and children used as soldiers and rape used as a weapon of war.
to this day, there are those who insist the holocaust never happened; who perpetrate every form of intolerance -- racism and anti-semitism, homophobia, xenophobia, sexism, and more -- hatred that degrades its victim and diminishes us all.
today, and every day, we have an opportunity, as well as an obligation, to confront these scourges -- to fight the impulse to turn the channel when we see images that disturb us, or wrap ourselves in the false comfort that others' sufferings are not our own.
instead we have the opportunity to make a habit of empathy; to recognize ourselves in each other; to commit ourselves to resisting injustice and intolerance and indifference in whatever forms they may take -- whether confronting those who tell lies about history, or doing everything we can to prevent and end atrocities like those that took place in rwanda, those taking place in darfur.
that is my commitment as president.
i hope that is yours, as well.
it will not be easy.
at times, fulfilling these obligations require self-reflection.
but in the final analysis, i believe history gives us cause for hope rather than despair --
the hope of a chosen people who have overcome oppression since the days of exodus; of the nation of israel rising from the destruction of the holocaust; of the strong and enduring bonds between our nations.
it is the hope, too, of those who not only survived, but chose to live, teaching us the meaning of courage and resilience and dignity.
i'm thinking today of a study conducted after the war that found that holocaust survivors living in america actually had a higher birthrate than american jews.
what a stunning act of faith -- to bring a child in a world that has shown you so much cruelty; to believe that no matter what you have endured, or how much you have lost, in the end, you have a duty to life.
we find cause for hope as well in protestant and catholic children attending school together in northern ireland; in hutus and tutsis living side by side, forgiving neighbors who have done the unforgivable; in a movement to save darfur that has thousands of high school and college chapters in 25 countries, and brought 70,000 people to the washington mall -- people of every age and faith and background and race united in common cause with suffering brothers and sisters halfway around the world.
those numbers can be our future -- our fellow citizens of the world showing us how to make the journey from oppression to survival, from witness to resistance, and ultimately to reconciliation.
that is what we mean when we say "never again."
so today, during this season when we celebrate liberation, resurrection, and the possibility of redemption, may each of us renew our resolve to do what must be done.
and may we strive each day, both individually and as a nation, to be among the righteous.
thank you, god bless you, and god bless the united states of america.
well, to president degioia, thank you so much for the gracious introduction, and thanks for bringing your family -- including jt -- appreciate you.
we're going to invite him over, hang out with the girls.
he's a pretty good-looking young man.
to mayor adrian fenty, who's doing such a great job in this city, thank you so much for your attendance.
to representative donna edwards, who is here and represents maryland's 4th district, thank you.
to georgetown university students, it is great to be here.
well, it is good to be back.
i appeared in this room during the campaign and had a wonderful reception then, and it's wonderful to be back and be with all of you.
we're going to talk about the economy today.
and i was telling president degioia this may be a slightly longer speech than i usually give, but it's a slightly bigger topic, and that is how we are going to deal with so many of our economic challenges.
you know, it's been 12 weeks now since my administration began.
and i think that even our critics would agree that at the very least, we've been busy.
in just under three months, we've responded to an extraordinary set of economic challenges with extraordinary action -- action that's been unprecedented both in terms of its scale and its speed.
and i know that some have accused us of taking on too much at once.
others believe we haven't done enough.
and many americans are simply wondering how all of our different programs and policies fit together in a single, overarching strategy that will move this economy from recession to recovery and ultimately to prosperity.
so today, i want to step back for a moment and explain our strategy as clearly as i can.
this is going to be prose, and not poetry.
i want to talk about what we've done, why we've done it, and what we have left to do.
i want to update you on the progress we've made, but i also want to be honest about the pitfalls that may still lie ahead.
most of all, i want every american to know that each action we take and each policy we pursue is driven by a larger vision of america's future -- a future where sustained economic growth creates good jobs and rising incomes; a future where prosperity is fueled not by excessive debt, or reckless speculation, or fleeting profits, but is instead built by skilled, productive workers, by sound investments that will spread opportunity at home and allow this nation to lead the world in the technologies and the innovation and discoveries that will shape the 21st century.
that's the america i see.
that's the america that georgetown is preparing so many of you for.
that is the future that i know that we can have.
now, to understand how we get there, we first need to understand how we got here.
recessions are not uncommon.
markets and economies naturally ebb and flow, as we've seen many times in our history.
but this recession is different.
this recession was not caused by a normal downturn in the business cycle.
it was caused by a perfect storm of irresponsibility and poor decision-making that stretched from wall street to washington to main street.
as has been widely reported, it started in the housing market.
during the course of the decade, the formula for buying a house changed: instead of saving their pennies to buy their dream house, many americans found that suddenly they could take out loans that by traditional standards their incomes just could not support.
others were tricked into signing these subprime loans by lenders who were trying to make a quick profit.
the reason these loans were so readily available was that wall street saw big profits to be made.
investment banks would buy and package together these questionable mortgages into securities, arguing that by pooling the mortgages the risks had somehow been reduced.
and credit agencies that are supposed to help investors determine the soundness of various investments stamped the securities with their safest rating when they should have been labeled "buyer beware."
no one really knew what the actual value of these securities were, no one fully understood what the risks were.
but since the housing market was booming and prices were rising, banks and investors just kept buying and selling them, always passing off the risk to someone else for a greater profit without having to take any of the ultimate responsibility.
banks took on more debt than they could handle.
the government-chartered companies fannie mae and freddie mac, whose traditional mandate was to help support traditional mortgages, decided to get in on the action by buying and holding billions of dollars of these securities.
aig, the biggest insurer in the world that had a very traditional insurance business that was very profitable, decided to make profits suddenly by selling billions of dollars of complicated financial instruments that supposedly insured these securities.
everybody was making record profits -- except the wealth created was real only on paper.
and as the bubble grew, there was almost no accountability or oversight from anyone in washington.
then the housing bubble burst.
home prices fell.
people began to default on their subprime mortgages.
and the value of all those loans and securities plummeted.
banks and investors couldn't find anyone to buy them.
greed gave way to fear.
investors pulled their money out of the market.
large financial institutions that didn't have enough money on hand to pay off all their obligations collapsed.
other banks held on tight to their money and simply stopped lending.
now, this is when the crisis spread from wall street to main street.
after all, the ability to get a loan is how you finance the purchase of everything from a home to a car to, as you all know very well, a college education.
it's how stores stock their shelves, and farms buy equipment, and businesses make payroll.
so when banks stopped lending money, businesses started laying off workers.
when laid-off workers had less money to spend, businesses were forced to lay off even more workers.
when people couldn't get a car loan, a bad situation at the auto companies became even worse.
when people couldn't get home loans, the crisis in the housing market only deepened.
because the infected securities were being traded worldwide and other nations also had weak regulations, this recession soon became global.
and when other nations can't afford to buy our goods, it slows our economy even further.
so this is the situation, the downward spiral that we confronted on the day that we took office.
so our most urgent task has been to clear away the wreckage, repair the immediate damage to the economy, and do everything we can to prevent a larger collapse.
and since the problems we face are all working off each other to feed a vicious economic downturn, we've had no choice but to attack all fronts of our economic crisis simultaneously.
the first step was to fight a severe shortage of demand in the economy.
so the federal reserve did this by dramatically lowering interest rates last year in order to boost investment.
my administration and congress boosted demand by passing the largest recovery plan in our nation's history.
it's a plan that's already in the process of saving or creating 3.5 million jobs over the next two years.
it's putting money directly into people's pockets with a tax cut for 95 percent of working families that's now showing up in paychecks across america.
and to cushion the blow of this recession, we also provided extended unemployment benefits and continued health care coverage to americans who've lost their jobs through no fault of their own.
now, you will recall that some argued this recovery plan is a case of irresponsible government spending, that it's somehow to blame for our long-term deficit projections, and that the federal government should be cutting instead of increasing spending right now.
so i want to tackle this argument head on.
to begin with, economists on both the left and the right agree that the last thing a government should do in the middle of a recession is to cut back on spending.
you see, when this recession began, many families sat around the kitchen table and tried to figure out where they could cut back.
and so have many businesses.
and this is a completely reasonable and understandable reaction.
but if everybody -- if everybody -- if every family in america, if every business in america cuts back all at once, then no one is spending any money, which means there are no customers, which means there are more layoffs, which means the economy gets even worse.
that's why the government has to step in and temporarily boost spending in order to stimulate demand.
that's exactly what we're doing right now.
second, i absolutely agree that our long-term deficit is a major problem that we have to fix.
but the fact is that this recovery plan represents only a tiny fraction of that long-term deficit.
as i'll discuss in a moment, the key to dealing with our long-term deficit and our national debt is to get a handle on out-of-control health care costs -- not to stand idly by as the economy goes into free fall.
so the recovery plan has been the first step in confronting this economic crisis.
the second step has been to heal our financial system so that credit is once again flowing to the businesses and families who rely on it.
the heart of this financial crisis is that too many banks and other financial institutions simply stopped lending money.
in a climate of fear, banks were unable to replace their losses from some of those bad mortgages by raising new capital on their own, and they were unwilling to lend the money they did have because they were afraid that no one would pay it back.
it's for this reason that the last administration used what they called the troubled asset relief program, or tarp, to provide these banks with temporary financial assistance in order to get them lending again.
now, i understand that tarp is not popular, and i have to say that i don't agree with some of the ways the tarp program was managed, but i do agree with the broader rationale that we must provide banks with the capital and the confidence necessary to start lending again.
that's the purpose of the stress tests that will soon tell us how much additional capital will be needed to support lending at our largest banks.
ideally, these needs will be met by private investors who are willing to put in money to these banks.
but where that's not possible, and banks require substantial additional resources from the government, then we will hold accountable those who are responsible, we'll force the necessary adjustments, we'll provide the support to clean up those bank balance sheets, and we will assure the continuity of a strong and viable institution that can serve our people and our economy.
of course, there are some who differ with our approach.
on the one hand, there are some who argue that the government should stand back and simply let these banks fail -- especially since in many cases it was their bad decisions that helped create the crisis in the first place.
but whether we like it or not, history has shown repeatedly that when nations do not take early and aggressive action to get credit flowing again, they have crises that last years and years instead of months and months -- years of low growth, years of low job creation, years of low investment, all of which cost these nations far more than a course of bold, upfront action.
and although there are a lot of americans who understandably think that government money would be better spent going directly to families and businesses instead of to banks -- one of my most frequent questions in the letters that i get from constituents is, "
where's my bailout?"
-- and i understand the sentiment.
it makes sense intuitively, and morally it makes sense, but the truth is that a dollar of capital in a bank can actually result in $8 or $10 of loans to families and businesses.
so that's a multiplier effect that can ultimately lead to a faster pace of economic growth.
that's why we have to fix the banks.
now, on the other hand, there have been some who don't dispute that we need to shore up the banking system, but they suggest that we've been too timid in how we go about it.
this is essentially the nationalization argument that some of you may have heard.
and the argument says that the federal government should have already preemptively stepped in and taken over major financial institutions the way that the fdic currently intervenes in smaller banks, and that our failure, my administration's failure to do so is yet another example of washington coddling wall street --
"why aren't you tougher on the banks?"
so let me be clear: the reason we have not taken this step has nothing to do with any ideological or political judgment we've made about government involvement in banks.
it's certainly not because of any concern we have for the management and shareholders whose actions helped to cause this mess.
rather, it's because we believe that preemptive government takeovers are likely to end up costing taxpayers even more in the end, and because it's more likely to undermine than create confidence.
governments should practice the same principle as doctors: first, do no harm.
so rest assured
-- we will do whatever is necessary to get credit flowing again, but we will do so in ways that minimize risks to taxpayers and to the broader economy.
to that end, in addition to the program to provide capital to the banks, we've launched a plan that will pair government resources with private investment in order to clear away the old loans and securities -- the so-called toxic assets -- that are also preventing our banks from lending money.
now, what we've also learned during this crisis is that our banks aren't the only institutions affected by these toxic assets that are clogging the financial system.
aig, for example, is not a bank, it's an insurance company, as i mentioned -- and yet because it chose to insure billions of dollars worth of risky assets, essentially creating a hedge fund on top of an insurance company, its failure could threaten the entire financial system and freeze lending even more.
and that's why, as frustrating as it is -- and i promise you,
nobody is more frustrated than me with aig
-- i promise -- we had to provide support for aig, because the entire system, as fragile as it is, could be profoundly endangered if aig went into a liquidation bankruptcy.
it's also why we need new legal authority so that we have the power to intervene in such financial institutions, the same way that bankruptcy courts currently do with businesses that hit hard times but don't pose systemic risks -- and that way we can restructure these businesses in an orderly way that doesn't induce panic in the financial system -- and, by the way, will allow us to restructure inappropriate bonus contracts without creating a perception the government can just change compensation rules on a whim.
this is also why we're moving aggressively to unfreeze markets and jumpstart lending outside the banking system, where more than half of all lending in america actually takes place.
to do this, we've started a program that will increase guarantees for small business loans and unlock the market for auto loans and student loans.
and to stabilize the housing market, we've launched a plan that will save up to four million responsible homeowners from foreclosure and help many millions more to refinance their homes.
in a few weeks, we will also reassess the state of chrysler and general motors, two companies with an important place in our history and a large footprint in our economy -- but two companies that have also fallen on hard times.
late last year, the companies were given transitional loans by the previous administration to tide them over as they worked to develop viable business plans.
unfortunately, the plans they developed fell short, so we've given them some additional time to work these complex issues through.
and by the way, we owed that not to the executives whose bad bets contributed to the weakening of their companies, but to the hundreds of thousands of workers whose livelihoods hang in the balance -- entire towns, entire communities, entire states are profoundly impacted by what happens in the auto industry.
now, it is our fervent hope that in the coming weeks, chrysler will find a viable partner and gm will develop a business plan that will put it on a path to profitability without endless support from american taxpayer.
in the meantime, we're taking steps to spur demand for american cars and provide relief for autoworkers and their communities.
and we will continue to reaffirm this nation's commitment to a 21st-century american auto industry that creates new jobs and builds the fuel-efficient cars and trucks that will carry us toward a clean-energy future.
finally, to coordinate a global response to this global recession, i went to the meeting of the g20 nations in london the other week.
each nation has undertaken significant stimulus to spur demand.
all agreed to pursue tougher regulatory reforms.
we also agreed to triple the lending capacity of the international monetary fund -- which, as many of you know, is an international financial institution supported by all the major economies -- so that they can provide direct assistance to developing nations and vulnerable populations.
that's not just charity; because america's success depends on whether other nations have the ability to buy what we sell, it's important that we pay attention to these emerging markets.
we pledged to avoid the trade barriers and protectionism that hurts us all in the end.
and we decided to meet again in the fall to gauge our progress and take additional steps if necessary.
so that's where we've been, that's what we've done in the last three months.
all of these actions -- the recovery act, the bank capitalization program, the housing plan, the strengthening of the non-bank credit market, the auto plan, and our work at the g20 -- all have been necessary pieces of the recovery puzzle.
they've been designed to increase aggregate demand to get credit flowing again to families and businesses and to help families and businesses ride out the storm.
and taken together, these actions are starting to generate signs of economic progress.
because of our recovery plan, schools and police departments have cancelled planned layoffs; clean energy companies and construction companies are re-hiring workers to build everything from energy-efficient windows to new roads and highways.
our housing plan has helped lead to a spike in the number of homeowners who are taking advantage of historically-low mortgage rates by refinancing, which is like putting a $2,000 tax cut in your pocket.
our program to support the market for auto loans and student loans has started to unfreeze this market and securitize more of this lending in the last few weeks.
and small businesses are seeing a jump in loan activity for the first time in months.
now, this is all welcome and encouraging news.
it does not mean the hard times are over; 2009 will continue to be a difficult year for america's economy, and obviously, most difficult for those who've lost their jobs.
the severity of this recession will cause more job loss, more foreclosures, and more pain before it ends.
the market will continue to rise and fall.
credit is still not flowing nearly as easily as it should.
the process for restructuring aig and the auto companies will involve difficult and sometimes unpopular choices; we are not finished yet on that front.
and all of this means that there's much more work to be done.
but all of this also means that you can continue to expect an unrelenting, unyielding, day-by-day effort from this administration to fight for economic recovery on all fronts.
but even as we continue to clear away the wreckage and address the immediate crisis, it is my firm belief that our next task, beginning now, is to make sure such a crisis never happens again.
even as we clean up balance sheets and get credit flowing again, even as people start spending and businesses start hiring -- all that's going to happen -- we have to realize that we cannot go back to the bubble-and-bust economy that led us to this point.
it is simply not sustainable to have a 21st-century financial system that is governed by 20th-century rules and regulations that allowed the recklessness of a few to threaten the entire economy.
it is not sustainable to have an economy where in one year, 40 percent of our corporate profits came from a financial sector that was based on inflated home prices, maxed-out credit cards, over-leveraged banks and overvalued assets.
it's not sustainable to have an economy where the incomes of the top 1 percent has skyrocketed while the typical working household has seen their incomes decline by nearly $2,000.
that's just not a sustainable model for long-term prosperity.
for even as too many were out there chasing ever-bigger bonuses and short-term profits over the last decade, we continued to neglect the long-term threats to our prosperity: the crushing burden that the rising cost of health care is placing on families and businesses; the failure of our education system to prepare our workers for a new age; the progress that other nations are making on clean energy industries and technologies while we -- we remain addicted to foreign oil; the growing debt that we're passing on to our children.
even after we emerge from the current recession, these challenges will still represent major obstacles that stand in the way of our success in the 21st century.
so we've got a lot of work to do.
now, there's a parable at the end of the sermon on the mount that tells the story of two men.
the first built his house on a pile of sand, and it was soon destroyed when a storm hit.
but the second is known as the wise man, for when "the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house, it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock.
"
it was founded upon a rock.
we cannot rebuild this economy on the same pile of sand.
we must build our house upon a rock.
we must lay a new foundation for growth and prosperity -- a foundation that will move us from an era of borrow and spend to one where we save and invest; where we consume less at home and send more exports abroad.
it's a foundation built upon five pillars that will grow our economy and make this new century another american century: number one, new rules for wall street that will reward drive and innovation, not reckless risk-taking; number two, new investments in education that will make our workforce more skilled and competitive; number three, new investments in renewable energy and technology that will create new jobs and new industries; number four, new investments in health care that will cut costs for families and businesses; and number five, new savings in our federal budget that will bring down the debt for future generations.
that's the new foundation we must build.
that's our house built upon a rock.
that must be our future -- and my administration's policies are designed to achieve that future.
let me talk about each of these steps in turn.
the first step we will take to build this foundation is to reform the outdated rules and regulations that allowed this crisis to happen in the first place.
it is time to lay down tough new rules of the road for wall street to ensure that we never find ourselves here again.
just as after the great depression new rules were designed for banks to avoid the kind of reckless speculation that helped to create the depression, so we've got to make adaptations to our current set of rules: create rules that punish shortcuts and abuse; rules that tie someone's pay to their actual job performance --- a novel concept; rules that protect typical american families when they buy a home, get a credit card or invest in a 401(k).
so we've already begun to work with congress to shape this comprehensive new regulatory framework -- and i expect a bill to arrive on my desk for my signature before the year is out.
the second pillar of this new foundation is an education system that finally prepares our workers for a 21st century economy.
you know, in the 20th century, the g.i. bill helped send a generation to college.
for decades we led the world in educational attainment, and as a consequence we led the world in economic growth.
but in this new economy, we've come to trail the world's leaders in graduation rates, in educational achievement, in the production of scientists and engineers.
that's why we have set a goal that will greatly enhance our ability to compete for the high-wage, high-tech jobs of the 21st century: by 2020, america will once again have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world.
that is the goal that we have set and we intend to do.
to meet that goal, we have to start early.
so we've already dramatically expanded early childhood education.
we are investing in innovative programs that have proven to help schools meet high standards and close achievement gaps.
we're creating new rewards that tie teachers' performance and new pathways for advancement.
and i've asked every american to commit to at least one year or more of higher education or career training, and we have provided tax credits to make a college education more affordable for every american, even those who attend georgetown.
and, by the way, one of the changes that i would like to see --
and i'm going to be talking about this in weeks to come -- is once again seeing our best and our brightest commit themselves to making things -- engineers, scientists, innovators.
for so long, we have placed at the top of our pinnacle folks who can manipulate numbers and engage in complex financial calculations.
and that's good
, we need some of that.
but you know what we can really use is some more scientists and some more engineers, who are building and making things that we can export to other countries.
now, the third pillar of this new foundation is to harness the renewable energy that can create millions of new jobs and new industries.
we all know that the country that harnesses this new energy source will lead the 21st century.
yet we've allowed other countries to outpace us on this race to the future.
i don't know about you, but i do not accept a future where the jobs and industries of tomorrow take root beyond our borders.
i think it's time for america to lead again.
so the investments we made in the recovery act will double this nation's supply of renewable energy in the next three years.
and we are putting americans to work making our homes and buildings more efficient so that we can save billions on our energy bills and grow our economy at the same time.
now, the only though that we can truly spark the transformation that's need is through a gradual, market-based cap on carbon pollution, so that clean energy is the profitable kind of energy.
there are those who've argued that we shouldn't attempt, we shouldn't even be thinking, we shouldn't even be talking about such a transition until the economy recovers.
and they are right that we have to take into account the costs of transition.
transitioning to a clean energy economy will not be easy.
but we can no longer delay putting a framework for a clean energy economy in place.
that needs to be done now.
if businesses and entrepreneurs know today that we are closing this carbon pollution loophole, they'll start investing in clean energy now.
and pretty soon, we'll see more companies constructing solar panels, and workers building wind turbines, and car companies manufacturing fuel-efficient cars.
investors will put some money into a new energy technology, and a small business will open to start selling it.
that's how we can grow this economy, enhance our security, and protect our planet at the same time.
now, the fourth pillar of our new foundation is a 21st century health care system where families, businesses and government budgets aren't dragged down by skyrocketing insurance premiums.
one and a half million americans could lose their homes this year just because of a medical crisis.
major american corporations are struggling to compete with their foreign counterparts.
small businesses are closing their doors.
we can't allow the cost of health care to continue strangling our economy.
and that's why our recovery act will invest in electronic health records with strict privacy standards that can save money and lives and reduce medical error.
that's why we've made the largest investment ever in preventive care, because that's one of the best ways to keep costs under control.
and included in the budgets that just passed congress is an historic commitment to reform that will finally make quality health care affordable for every american.
so i'm looking forward in the next few months to working with both parties in congress to make this reform a reality.
we can get this done -- and we have to get it done.
now, fixing our health care system will -- will require resources; it's not going to be free.
but in my budget we've made a commitment to fully pay for reform without increasing the deficit, and we've identified specific savings that will make the health care system more efficient and reduce costs for us all.
in fact, we've undertaken an unprecedented effort to find this kind of savings in every corner of the budget, because the final pillar in building our new foundation is restoring fiscal discipline once this economy recovers.
already we've identified $2 trillion dollars in deficit reductions over the next decade.
we need to do more, but we've already done that.
we've announced procurement reform that will greatly reduce no-bid contracts and save the government $40 billion.
we need to do more, but that's an important start.
secretary gates recently announced a courageous set of reforms that go right at the hundreds of billions of dollars in waste and cost overruns that have bloated our defense budget without making america safer.
we need to do more, but that proposal by secretary gates is right on target.
we will end education programs that don't work, we will root out waste and fraud and abuse in our medicare program.
altogether, this budget will reduce discretionary spending for domestic programs as a share of the economy by more than 10 percent over the next decade to the lowest level we've seen since we began keeping records nearly half a century ago.
and as we continue to go through the federal budget line by line, we will be announcing additional savings, secured by eliminating and consolidating programs that we don't need
so we can make room for the things that we do need.
that's what we're doing now.
of course, i realize that for some, this isn't enough.
i know there's a criticism out there that my administration has been spending with reckless abandon, pushing a liberal social agenda while mortgaging our children's future.
you've heard the argument.
well, let me make three points.
first, as i said earlier, the worst thing that we could do in a recession this severe is to try to cut government spending at the same time as families and businesses around the world are cutting back on their spending.
so as serious as our deficit and debt problems are -- and they are very serious -- major efforts to deal with them have to focus on the medium and long-term budget picture, not on the short-term.
and that's exactly what we've done.
second, in tackling the deficit issue, we simply cannot sacrifice the long-term investments that we so desperately need to generate long-term prosperity.
that's the argument that some critics have made:
well, you're proposing health care reform, you shouldn't be doing that; you're proposing education investments, you shouldn't be doing that, that adds to the deficit.
look, just as a cash-strapped family may cut back on all kinds of luxuries, but will still insist on spending money to get their children through college, will refuse to have their kids drop out of college and go to work in some fast-food place, even though that might bring in some income in the short-term, because they're thinking about the long term --
so we as a country have to make current choices with an eye for the future.
if we don't invest now in renewable energy, if we don't invest now in a skilled workforce, if we don't invest now in a more affordable health care system, this economy simply won't grow at the pace it needs to in two or five or 10 years down the road.
if we don't lay this new foundation now, it won't be long before we're right back where we are today.
and i can assure you that chronically slow growth will not help our long-term budget situation.
that's the second point.
third point, the problem with our deficit and debt is not new.
it has been building dramatically over the past eight years, largely because big tax cuts combined with increased spending on two wars and the increased costs of government health care programs have pushed it ever upwards.
this structural gap in our budget, between the amount of money that's coming in and the amount of money that's going out, will only get worse as the baby boomers age, and will in fact lead us down an unsustainable path.
but let's not kid ourselves and suggest that we can solve this problem by trimming a few earmarks or cutting the budget for the national endowment for the arts.
that's just not true.
along with defense and interest on the national debt, the biggest cost drivers in our budget are entitlement programs like medicare, medicaid, and social security -- all of which get more and more expensive every year.
so if we want to get serious about fiscal discipline, and i do, then we're going to not only have to trim waste out of our discretionary budget -- which we've already begun -- we will also have to get serious about entitlement reform.
now, nothing will be more important to this goal than passing health care reform that brings down costs across the system, including in medicare and medicaid.
so make no mistake, health care reform is entitlement reform.
that's not just my opinion -- that was the conclusion of a wide range of participants at the fiscal responsibility summit that we held at the white house in february.
and that's one of the reasons why i firmly believe we need to get health care reform done this year.
once we tackle rising health care costs, we must also work to put social security on firmer footing.
it's time for both parties to come together and find a way to keep the promise of a sound retirement for future generations.
and we should restore a sense of fairness and balance to our tax code including by shutting down corporate loopholes and ensuring that everyone pays what they owe.
all of these efforts will require tough choices.
all these efforts will require compromise.
but the difficulties can't serve as an excuse for inaction -- not anymore -- which brings me to one final point i'd like to make today.
i've talked a lot about the fundamental weakness in our economy that led us to this day of reckoning.
but we also arrived here because of a fundamental weakness in our political system.
for too long, too many in washington put off hard decisions for some other time on some other day.
there's been a tendency to spend a lot of time scoring political points instead of rolling up sleeves to solve real problems.
there's also an impatience that characterizes this town -- an attention span that has only grown shorter with the 24-hour news cycle that insists on instant gratification in the form of immediate results or higher poll numbers.
when a crisis hits, there's all too often a lurch from shock to trance, with everyone responding to the tempest of the moment until the furor has died down, the media coverage has moved on to something else, instead of confronting the major challenges that will shape our future in a sustained and focused way.
this can't be one of those times.
the challenges are too great.
the stakes are too high.
i know how difficult it is for members of congress in both parties to grapple with some of the big decisions we face right now.
i'd love if these problems were coming at us one at a time instead of five or six at a time.
it's more than most congresses and most presidents have to deal with in a lifetime.
but we have been called to govern in extraordinary times.
and that requires an extraordinary sense of responsibility -- to ourselves, to the men and women who sent us here, to the many generations whose lives will be affected for good or for ill because of what we do here.
there is no doubt that times are still tough.
by no means are we out of the woods just yet.
but from where we stand, for the very first time, we're beginning to see glimmers of hope.
and beyond that, way off in the distance, we can see a vision of an america's future that is far different than our troubled economic past.
it's an america teeming with new industry and commerce, humming with new energy and discoveries that light the world once more -- a place where anyone from anywhere with a good idea or the will to work can live the dream they've heard so much about.
that is the house upon the rock -- proud, sturdy, unwavering in the face of the greatest storms.
and we will not finish it in one year.
we will not finish it in many.
but if we use this moment to lay that new foundation, if we come together and begin the hard work of rebuilding, if we persist and persevere against the disappointments and setbacks that will surely lie ahead, then i have no doubt that this house will stand and the dream of our founders will live on in our time.
thank you.
god bless you.
god bless the united states of america.
thank you.
thank you, guys.
let me say multinational force iraq, multinational corps iraq, multinational security transition command iraq first corps, america's corp band:

: i love you back.
i am honored -- i'm honored and grateful to be with all of you.
and i'm not going to talk long because i want to shake as many hands as i can.
and i've been talking all week.
but there's a couple of things i want to say.
number one, thank you.
you know, when i was at camp lejeune
i spoke about what it means for america to see our best and brightest, our finest young men and women serve us.
and what i said then is something that i want to repeat to you, which is: you have performed brilliantly in every mission that has been given to you.
under enormous strain and under enormous sacrifice, through controversy and difficulty and politics, you've kept your eyes focused on just doing your job.
and because of that, every mission that's been assigned -- from getting rid of saddam, to reducing violence, to stabilizing the country, to facilitating elections -- you have given iraq the opportunity to stand on its own as a democratic country.
that is an extraordinary achievement, and for that you have the thanks of the american people.
that's point number one.
point number two is, this is going to be a critical period, these next 18 months.
i was just discussing this with your commander, but i think it's something that all of you know.
it is time for us to transition to the iraqis.
they need to take responsibility for their country and for their sovereignty.
and in order for them to do that, they have got to make political accommodations.
they're going to have to decide that they want to resolve their differences through constitutional means and legal means.
they are going to have to focus on providing government services that encourage confidence among their citizens.
all those things they have to do.
we can't do it for them.
but what we can do is make sure that we are a stalwart partner, that we are working alongside them, that we are committed to their success, that in terms of training their security forces, training their civilian forces in order to achieve a more effective government, they know that they have a steady partner with us.
and so just as we thank you for what you've already accomplished
, i want to say thank you because you will be critical in terms of us being able to make sure that iraq is stable, that it is not a safe haven for terrorists, that it is a good neighbor and a good ally, and we can start bringing our folks home.
so now is not the time to lose focus.
we have to be even more focused than we've been in order to achieve success.
the last point i want to make
is
i know how hard it's been on a lot of you.
you've been away from your families, many of you for multiple rotations.
you've seen buddies of yours injured and you remember those who have made the ultimate sacrifice.
there are probably some people here who have seen children born and have been missing watching them grow up.
there are many of you who have listened to your spouse and the extraordinary sacrifices that they have to make when you're gone.
and so i want you to know that michelle and myself are doing everything -- are doing everything we can to provide additional support for military families.
the federal budget that i have introduced increases support for military families.
we are going to do everything required to make sure that the commitment we make to our veterans is met, and that people don't have to fight for what they have earned as a consequence of their service.
the main point i want to make is we have not forgotten what you have already done, we are grateful for what you will do, and as long as i am in the white house, you are going to get the support that you need and the thanks that you deserve from a grateful nation.
so thank you very much everybody.
god bless you.
god bless the united states of america.
mr. speaker, madam deputy speaker, distinguished members, i am honored to speak in this chamber, and i am committed to renewing the alliance between our nations and the friendship between our people.
this is my first trip overseas as president of the united states.
i've been to the g20 summit in london, and the nato summit in strasbourg, and the european union summit in prague.
some people have asked me if i chose to continue my travels to ankara and istanbul to send a message to the world.
and my answer is simple: evet --
yes.
turkey is a critical ally.
turkey is an important part of europe.
and turkey and the united states must stand together -- and work together -- to overcome the challenges of our time.
this morning i had the great privilege of visiting the tomb of your extraordinary founder of your republic.
and i was deeply impressed by this beautiful memorial to a man who did so much to shape the course of history.
but it is also clear that the greatest monument to ataturk's life is not something that can be cast in stone and marble.
his greatest legacy is turkey's strong, vibrant, secular democracy, and that is the work that this assembly carries on today.
this future was not easily assured, it was not guaranteed.
at the end of world war
i, turkey could have succumbed to the foreign powers that were trying to claim its territory, or sought to restore an ancient empire.
but turkey chose a different future.
you freed yourself from foreign control, and you founded a republic that commands the respect of the united states and the wider world.
and there is a simple truth to this story: turkey's democracy is your own achievement.
it was not forced upon you by any outside power, nor did it come without struggle and sacrifice.
turkey draws strength from both the successes of the past, and from the efforts of each generation of turks that makes new progress for your people.
now, my country's democracy has its own story.
the general who led america in revolution and governed as our first president was, as many of you know, george washington.
and like you, we built a grand monument to honor our founding father -- a towering obelisk that stands in the heart of the capital city that bears washington's name.
i can see the washington monument from the window of the white house every day.
it took decades to build.
there were frequent delays.
over time, more and more people contributed to help make this monument
the inspiring structure that still stands tall today.
among those who came to our aid were friends from all across the world who offered their own tributes to washington and the country he helped to found.
and one of those tributes came from istanbul.
ottoman sultan abdulmecid sent a marble plaque that helped to build the washington monument.
inscribed in the plaque was a poem that began with a few simple words: "so as to strengthen the friendship between the two countries.
" over 150 years have passed since those words were carved into marble.
our nations have changed in many ways.
but our friendship is strong, and our alliance endures.
it is a friendship that flourished in the years after world war ii, when president truman committed our nation to the defense of turkey's freedom and sovereignty, and turkey committed itself into the nato alliance.
turkish troops have served by our side from korea to kosovo to kabul.
together, we withstood the great test of the cold war.
trade between our nations has steadily advanced.
so has cooperation in science and research.
the ties among our people have deepened, as well, and more and more americans of turkish origin live and work and succeed within our borders.
and as a basketball fan, i've even noticed that hedo turkoglu and mehmet okur have got some pretty good basketball games.
the united states and turkey have not always agreed on every issue, and that's to be expected -- no two nations do.
but we have stood together through many challenges over the last 60 years.
and because of the strength of our alliance and the endurance of our friendship, both america and turkey are stronger and the world is more secure.
now, our two democracies are confronted by an unprecedented set of challenges: an economic crisis that recognizes no borders; extremism that leads to the killing of innocent men and women and children; strains on our energy supply and a changing climate; the proliferation of the world's deadliest weapons; and the persistence of tragic conflict.
these are the great tests of our young century.
and the choices that we make in the coming years will determine whether the future will be shaped by fear or by freedom; by poverty or by prosperity; by strife or by a just, secure and lasting peace.
this much is certain: no one nation can confront these challenges alone, and all nations have a stake in overcoming them.
that is why we must listen to one another, and seek common ground.
that is why we must build on our mutual interests, and rise above our differences.
we are stronger when we act together.
that is the message that i've carried with me throughout this trip to europe.
that is the message that i delivered when i had the privilege of meeting with your president and with your prime minister.
that will be the approach of the united states of america going forward.
already, america and turkey are working with the g20 on an unprecedented response to an unprecedented economic crisis.
now, this past week, we came together to ensure that the world's largest economies take strong and coordinated action to stimulate growth and restore the flow of credit; to reject the pressures of protectionism, and to extend a hand to developing countries and the people hit hardest by this downturn; and to dramatically reform our regulatory system so that the world never faces a crisis like this again.
as we go forward, the united states and turkey can pursue many opportunities to serve prosperity for our people.
the president and i this morning talked about expanding the ties of commerce and trade.
there's enormous opportunity when it comes to energy to create jobs.
and we can increase new sources to not only free ourselves from dependence of other energies -- other countries' energy sources, but also to combat climate change.
we should build on our clean technology fund to leverage efficiency and renewable energy investments in turkey.
and to power markets in turkey and europe, the united states will continue to support your central role as an east-west corridor for oil and natural gas.
this economic cooperation only reinforces the common security that europe and the united states share with turkey as a nato ally, and the common values that we share as democracies.
so in meeting the challenges of the 21st century, we must seek the strength of a europe that is truly united, peaceful and free.
so let me be clear: the united states strongly supports turkey's bid to become a member of the european union.
we speak not as members of the eu, but as close friends of both turkey and europe.
turkey has been a resolute ally and a responsible partner in transatlantic and european institutions.
turkey is bound to europe by more than the bridges over the bosphorous.
centuries of shared history, culture, and commerce bring you together.
europe gains by the diversity of ethnicity, tradition and faith -- it is not diminished by it.
and turkish membership would broaden and strengthen europe's foundation once more.
now, of course, turkey has its own responsibilities.
and you've made important progress towards membership.
but i also know that turkey has pursued difficult political reforms not simply because it's good for eu membership, but because it's right for turkey.
in the last several years, you've abolished state security courts, you've expanded the right to counsel.
you've reformed the penal code and strengthened laws that govern the freedom of the press and assembly.
you've lifted bans on teaching and broadcasting kurdish, and the world noted with respect the important signal sent through a new state kurdish television station.
these achievements have created new laws that must be implemented, and a momentum that should be sustained.
for democracies cannot be static -- they must move forward.
freedom of religion and expression lead to a strong and vibrant civil society that only strengthens the state, which is why steps like reopening halki seminary will send such an important signal inside turkey and beyond.
an enduring commitment to the rule of law is the only way to achieve the security that comes from justice for all people.
robust minority rights let societies benefit from the full measure of contributions from all citizens.
i say this as the president of a country that not very long ago made it hard for somebody who looks like me to vote, much less be president of the united states.
but it is precisely that capacity to change that enriches our countries.
every challenge that we face is more easily met if we tend to our own democratic foundation.
this work is never over.
that's why, in the united states, we recently ordered the prison at guantanamo bay closed.
that's why we prohibited -- without exception or equivocation -- the use of torture.
all of us have to change.
and sometimes change is hard.
another issue that confronts all democracies as they move to the future is how we deal with the past.
the united states is still working through some of our own darker periods in our history.
facing the washington monument that i spoke of is a memorial of abraham lincoln, the man who freed those who were enslaved even after washington led our revolution.
our country still struggles with the legacies of slavery and segregation, the past treatment of native americans.
human endeavor is by its nature imperfect.
history is often tragic, but unresolved, it can be a heavy weight.
each country must work through its past.
and reckoning with the past can help us seize a better future.
i know there's strong views in this chamber about the terrible events of 1915.
and while there's been a good deal of commentary about my views, it's really about how the turkish and armenian people deal with the past.
and the best way forward for the turkish and armenian people is a process that works through the past in a way that is honest, open and constructive.
we've already seen historic and courageous steps taken by turkish and armenian leaders.
these contacts hold out the promise of a new day.
an open border would return the turkish and armenian people to a peaceful and prosperous coexistence that would serve both of your nations.
so i want you to know that the united states strongly supports the full normalization of relations between turkey and armenia.
it is a cause worth working towards.
it speaks to turkey's leadership that you are poised to be the only country in the region to have normal and peaceful relations with all the south caucasus nations.
and to advance that peace, you can play a constructive role in helping to resolve the nagorno-karabakh conflict, which has continued for far too long.
advancing peace also includes the disputes that persist in the eastern mediterranean.
and here there's a cause for hope.
the two cypriot leaders have an opportunity through their commitment to negotiations under the united nations good offices mission.
the united states is willing to offer all the help sought by the parties as they work towards a just and lasting settlement that reunifies cyprus into a bizonal and bicommunal federation.
these efforts speak to one part of the critical region that surrounds turkey.
and when we consider the challenges before us, on issue after issue, we share common goals.
in the middle east, we share the goal of a lasting peace between israel and its neighbors.
let me be clear: the united states strongly supports the goal of two states, israel and palestine, living side by side in peace and security.
that is a goal shared by palestinians, israelis, and people of goodwill around the world.
that is a goal that the parties agreed to in the road map and at annapolis.
that is a goal that i will actively pursue as president of the united states.
we know the road ahead will be difficult.
both israelis and palestinians must take steps that are necessary to build confidence and trust.
both israelis and palestinians, both must live up to the commitments they have made.
both must overcome longstanding passions and the politics of the moment to make progress towards a secure and lasting peace.
the united states and turkey can help the palestinians and israelis make this journey.
like the united states, turkey has been a friend and partner in israel's quest for security.
and like the united states, you seek a future of opportunity and statehood for the palestinians.
so now, working together, we must not give into pessimism and mistrust.
we must pursue every opportunity for progress, as you've done by supporting negotiations between syria and israel.
we must extend a hand to those palestinians who are in need, while helping them strengthen their own institutions.
we must reject the use of terror, and recognize that israel's security concerns are legitimate.
the peace of the region will also be advanced if iran forgoes any nuclear weapons ambitions.
now, as i made clear in prague yesterday, no one is served by the spread of nuclear weapons, least of all turkey.
you live in a difficult region and a nuclear arm race would not serve the security of this nation well.
this part of the world has known enough violence.
it has known enough hatred.
it does not need a race for an ever-more powerful tool of destruction.
now, i have made it clear to the people and leaders of the islamic republic of iran that the united states seeks engagement based on mutual interest and mutual respect.
we want iran to play its rightful role in the community of nations.
iran is a great civilization.
we want them to engage in the economic and political integration that brings prosperity and security.
but iran's leaders must choose whether they will try to build a weapon or build a better future for their people.
so both turkey and the united states support a secure and united iraq that does not serve as a safe haven for terrorists.
i know there were differences about whether to go to war.
there were differences within my own country, as well.
but now we must come together as we end this war responsibly, because the future of iraq is inseparable from the future of the broader region.
as i've already announced, and many of you are aware, the united states will remove our combat brigades by the end of next august, while working with the iraqi government as they take responsibility for security.
and we will work with iraq, turkey, and all iraq's neighbors, to forge a new dialogue that reconciles differences and advances our common security.
make no mistake, though: iraq, turkey, and the united states face a common threat from terrorism.
that includes the al qaeda terrorists who have sought to drive iraqis apart and destroy their country.
that includes the pkk.
there is no excuse for terror against any nation.
as president, and as a nato ally, i pledge that you will have our support against the terrorist activities of the pkk or anyone else.
these efforts will be strengthened by the continued work to build ties of cooperation between turkey, the iraqi government, and iraq's kurdish leaders, and by your continued efforts to promote education and opportunity and democracy for the kurdish population here inside turkey.
finally, we share the common goal of denying al qaeda a safe haven in pakistan or afghanistan.
the world has come too far to let this region backslide, and to let al qaeda terrorists plot further attacks.
that's why we are committed to a more focused effort to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al qaeda.
that is why we are increasing our efforts to train afghans to sustain their own security, and to reconcile former adversaries.
that's why we are increasing our support for the people of afghanistan and pakistan, so that we stand on the side not only of security, but also of opportunity and the promise of a better life.
turkey has been a true partner.
your troops were among the first in the international security assistance force.
you have sacrificed much in this endeavor.
now we must achieve our goals together.
i appreciate that you've offered to help us train and support afghan security forces, and expand opportunity across the region.
together, we can rise to meet this challenge like we have so many before.
i know there have been difficulties these last few years.
i know that the trust that binds the united states and turkey has been strained, and i know that strain is shared in many places where the muslim faith is practiced.
so let me say this as clearly as i can: the united states is not, and will never be, at war with islam.
in fact, our partnership with the muslim world is critical not just in rolling back the violent ideologies that people of all faiths reject, but also to strengthen opportunity for all its people.
i also want to be clear that america's relationship with the muslim community, the muslim world, cannot, and will not, just be based upon opposition to terrorism.
we seek broader engagement based on mutual interest and mutual respect.
we will listen carefully, we will bridge misunderstandings, and we will seek common ground.
we will be respectful, even when we do not agree.
we will convey our deep appreciation for the islamic faith, which has done so much over the centuries to shape the world -- including in my own country.
the united states has been enriched by muslim americans.
many other americans have muslims in their families or have lived in a muslim-majority country.
i know, because i am one of them.
above all, above all we will demonstrate through actions our commitment to a better future.
i want to help more children get the education that they need to succeed.
we want to promote health care in places where people are vulnerable.
we want to expand the trade and investment that can bring prosperity for all people.
in the months ahead, i will present specific programs to advance these goals.
our focus will be on what we can do, in partnership with people across the muslim world, to advance our common hopes and our common dreams.
and when people look back on this time, let it be said of america that we extended the hand of friendship to all people.
there's an old turkish proverb: "you cannot put out fire with flames.
"
america knows this.
turkey knows this.
there's some who must be met by force, they will not compromise.
but force alone cannot solve our problems, and it is no alternative to extremism.
the future must belong to those who create, not those who destroy.
that is the future we must work for, and we must work for it together.
i know there are those who like to debate turkey's future.
they see your country at the crossroads of continents, and touched by the currents of history.
they know that this has been a place where civilizations meet, and different peoples come together.
they wonder whether you will be pulled in one direction or another.
but i believe here is what they don't understand: turkey's greatness lies in your ability to be at the center of things.
this is not where east and west divide -- this is where they come together.
in the beauty of your culture.
in the richness of your history.
in the strength of your democracy.
in your hopes for tomorrow.
i am honored to stand here with you -- to look forward to the future that we must reach for together -- and to reaffirm america's commitment to our strong and enduring friendship.
thank you very much.
thank you.
thank you.
thank you so much.
thank you for this wonderful welcome.
thank you to the people of prague.
thank you to the people of the czech republic.
*
today, i'm proud to stand here with you in the middle of this great city, in the center of europe.
and, to paraphrase one of my predecessors, i am also proud to be the man who brought michelle obama to prague.1

to mr. president, mr. prime minister, to all the dignitaries who are here, thank you for your extraordinary hospitality.
and to the people of the czech republic, thank you for your friendship to the united states.
i've learned over many years to appreciate the good company and the good humor of the czech people in my hometown of chicago.
behind me is a statue of a hero of the czech people -- tomas masaryk.
in 1918, after america had pledged its support for czech independence, masaryk spoke to a crowd in chicago that was estimated to be over 100,000.
i don't think i can match his record -- but i am honored to follow his footsteps from chicago to prague.
for over a thousand years, prague has set itself apart from any other city in any other place.
you've known war and peace.
you've seen empires rise and fall.
you've led revolutions in the arts and science, in politics and in poetry.
through it all, the people of prague have insisted on pursuing their own path, and defining their own destiny.
and this city -- this golden city which is both ancient and youthful -- stands as a living monument to your unconquerable spirit.
when i was born, the world was divided, and our nations were faced with very different circumstances.
few people would have predicted that someone like me would one day become the president of the united states.
few people would have predicted that an american president would one day be permitted to speak to an audience like this in prague.
few would have imagined that the czech republic would become a free nation, a member of nato, a leader of a united europe.
those ideas would have been dismissed as dreams.
we are here today because enough people ignored the voices who told them that the world could not change.
we're here today because of the courage of those who stood up and took risks to say that freedom is a right for all people, no matter what side of a wall they live on, and no matter what they look like.
we are here today because of the prague spring -- because the simple and principled pursuit of liberty and opportunity shamed those who relied on the power of tanks and arms to put down the will of a people.
we are here today because 20 years ago, the people of this city took to the streets to claim the promise of a new day, and the fundamental human rights that had been denied them for far too long.
sametová revoluce --
the velvet revolution taught us many things.
it showed us that peaceful protest could shake the foundations of an empire, and expose the emptiness of an ideology.
it showed us that small countries can play a pivotal role in world events, and that young people can lead the way in overcoming old conflicts.
and it proved that moral leadership is more powerful than any weapon.
that's why i'm speaking to you in the center of a europe that is peaceful, united and free -- because ordinary people believed that divisions could be bridged, even when their leaders did not.
they believed that walls could come down; that peace could prevail.
we are here today because americans and czechs believed against all odds that today could be possible.
now, we share this common history.
but now this generation -- our generation -- cannot stand still.
we, too, have a choice to make.
as the world has become less divided, it has become more interconnected.
and we've seen events move faster than our ability to control them --
a global economy in crisis, a changing climate, the persistent dangers of old conflicts, new threats and the spread of catastrophic weapons.
none of these challenges can be solved quickly or easily.
but all of them demand that we listen to one another and work together; that we focus on our common interests, not on occasional differences; and that we reaffirm our shared values, which are stronger than any force that could drive us apart.
that is the work that we must carry on.
that is the work that i have come to europe to begin.
to renew our prosperity, we need action coordinated across borders.
that means investments to create new jobs.
that means resisting the walls of protectionism that stand in the way of growth.
that means a change in our financial system, with new rules to prevent abuse and future crisis.
and we have an obligation to our common prosperity and our common humanity to extend a hand to those emerging markets and impoverished people who are suffering the most, even though they may have had very little to do with financial crises, which is why we set aside over a trillion dollars for the international monetary fund earlier this week, to make sure that everybody -- everybody -- receives some assistance.
now, to protect our planet, now is the time to change the way that we use energy.
together, we must confront climate change by ending the world's dependence on fossil fuels, by tapping the power of new sources of energy like the wind and sun, and calling upon all nations to do their part.
and i pledge to you that in this global effort, the united states is now ready to lead.
to provide for our common security, we must strengthen our alliance.
nato was founded 60 years ago, after communism took over czechoslovakia.
that was when the free world learned too late that it could not afford division.
so we came together to forge the strongest alliance that the world has ever known.
and we should -- stood shoulder to shoulder -- year after year, decade after decade -- until an iron curtain was lifted, and freedom spread like flowing water.
this marks the 10th year of nato membership for the czech republic.
and i know that many times in the 20th century, decisions were made without you at the table.
great powers let you down, or determined your destiny without your voice being heard.
i am here to say that the united states will never turn its back on the people of this nation.
we are bound by shared values, shared history -- we are bound by shared values and shared history and the enduring promise of our alliance.
nato's article v states it clearly: an attack on one is an attack on all.
that is a promise for our time, and for all time.
the people of the czech republic kept that promise after america was attacked; thousands were killed on our soil, and nato responded.
nato's mission in afghanistan is fundamental to the safety of people on both sides of the atlantic.
we are targeting the same al qaeda terrorists who have struck from new york to london, and helping the afghan people take responsibility for their future.
we are demonstrating that free nations can make common cause on behalf of our common security.
and i want you to know that we honor the sacrifices of the czech people in this endeavor, and mourn the loss of those you've lost.
but no alliance can afford to stand still.
we must work together as nato members so that we have contingency plans in place to deal with new threats, wherever they may come from.
we must strengthen our cooperation with one another, and with other nations and institutions around the world, to confront dangers that recognize no borders.
and we must pursue constructive relations with russia on issues of common concern.
now, one of those issues that i'll focus on today is fundamental to the security of our nations and to the peace of the world -- that's the future of nuclear weapons in the 21st century.
the existence of thousands of nuclear weapons is the most dangerous legacy of the cold war.
no nuclear war was fought between the united states and the soviet union, but generations lived with the knowledge that their world could be erased in a single flash of light.
cities like prague that existed for centuries, that embodied the beauty and the talent of so much of humanity, would have ceased to exist.
today, the cold war has disappeared but thousands of those weapons have not.
in a strange turn of history, the threat of global nuclear war has gone down, but the risk of a nuclear attack has gone up.
more nations have acquired these weapons.
testing has continued.
black market trade in nuclear secrets and nuclear materials abound.
the technology to build a bomb has spread.
terrorists are determined to buy, build or steal one.
our efforts to contain these dangers are centered on a global non-proliferation regime, but as more people and nations break the rules, we could reach the point where the center cannot hold.
now, understand, this matters to people everywhere.
one nuclear weapon exploded in one city -- be it new york or moscow, islamabad or mumbai, tokyo or tel aviv, paris or prague -- could kill hundreds of thousands of people.
and no matter where it happens, there is no end to what the consequences might be -- for our global safety, our security, our society, our economy, to our ultimate survival.
some argue that the spread of these weapons cannot be stopped, cannot be checked -- that we are destined to live in a world where more nations and more people possess the ultimate tools of destruction.
such fatalism is a deadly adversary, for if we believe that the spread of nuclear weapons is inevitable, then in some way we are admitting to ourselves that the use of nuclear weapons is inevitable.
just as we stood for freedom in the 20th century, we must stand together for the right of people everywhere to live free from fear in the 21st century.
and as nuclear power -- as a nuclear power, as the only nuclear power to have used a nuclear weapon, the united states has a moral responsibility to act.
we cannot succeed in this endeavor alone, but we can lead it, we can start it.
so today, i state clearly and with conviction america's commitment to seek the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons.
i'm not naive.
this goal will not be reached quickly -- perhaps not in my lifetime.
it will take patience and persistence.
but now we, too, must ignore the voices who tell us that the world cannot change.
we have to insist, "yes, we can."
now, let me describe to you the trajectory we need to be on.
first, the united states will take concrete steps towards a world without nuclear weapons.
to put an end to cold war thinking, we will reduce the role of nuclear weapons in our national security strategy, and urge others to do the same.
make no mistake: as long as these weapons exist, the united states will maintain a safe, secure and effective arsenal to deter any adversary, and guarantee that defense to our allies -- including the czech republic.
but we will begin the work of reducing our arsenal.
to reduce our warheads and stockpiles, we will negotiate a new strategic arms reduction treaty with the russians this year.
president medvedev and
i began this process in london, and will seek a new agreement by the end of this year that is legally binding and sufficiently bold.
and this will set the stage for further cuts, and we will seek to include all nuclear weapons states in this endeavor.
to achieve a global ban on nuclear testing, my administration will immediately and aggressively pursue u.s. ratification of the comprehensive test ban treaty.
after more than five decades of talks, it is time for the testing of nuclear weapons to finally be banned.
and to cut off the building blocks needed for a bomb, the united states will seek a new treaty that verifiably ends the production of fissile materials intended for use in state nuclear weapons.
if we are serious about stopping the spread of these weapons, then we should put an end to the dedicated production of weapons-grade materials that create them.
that's the first step.
second, together we will strengthen the nuclear non-proliferation treaty as a basis for cooperation.
the basic bargain is sound: countries with nuclear weapons will move towards disarmament, countries without nuclear weapons will not acquire them, and all countries can access peaceful nuclear energy.
to strengthen the treaty, we should embrace several principles.
we need more resources and authority to strengthen international inspections.
we need real and immediate consequences for countries caught breaking the rules or trying to leave the treaty without cause.
and we should build a new framework for civil nuclear cooperation, including an international fuel bank, so that countries can access peaceful power without increasing the risks of proliferation.
that must be the right of every nation that renounces nuclear weapons,
especially developing countries embarking on peaceful programs.
and no approach will succeed if it's based on the denial of rights to nations that play by the rules.
we must harness the power of nuclear energy on behalf of our efforts to combat climate change, and to advance peace opportunity for all people.
but we go forward with no illusions.
some countries will break the rules.
that's why we need a structure in place that ensures when any nation does, they will face consequences.
just this morning, we were reminded again of why we need a new and more rigorous approach to address this threat.
north korea broke the rules once again by testing a rocket that could be used for long range missiles.
this provocation underscores the need for action -- not just this afternoon at the u.n. security council, but in our determination to prevent the spread of these weapons.
rules must be binding.
violations must be punished.
words must mean something.
the world must stand together to prevent the spread of these weapons.
now is the time for a strong international response -- now is the time for a strong international response, and north korea must know that the path to security and respect will never come through threats and illegal weapons.
all nations must come together to build a stronger, global regime.
and that's why we must stand shoulder to shoulder to pressure the north koreans to change course.
iran has yet to build a nuclear weapon.
my administration will seek engagement with iran based on mutual interests and mutual respect.
we believe in dialogue.
but in that dialogue we will present a clear choice.
we want iran to take its rightful place in the community of nations, politically and economically.
we will support iran's right to peaceful nuclear energy with rigorous inspections.
that's a path that the islamic republic can take.
or the government can choose increased isolation, international pressure, and a potential nuclear arms race in the region that will increase insecurity for all.
so let me be clear: iran's nuclear and ballistic missile activity poses a real threat, not just to the united states, but to iran's neighbors and our allies.
the czech republic and poland have been courageous in agreeing to host a defense against these missiles.
as long as the threat from iran persists, we will go forward with a missile defense system that is cost-effective and proven.
if the iranian threat is eliminated, we will have a stronger basis for security, and the driving force for missile defense construction in europe will be removed.
so, finally, we must ensure that terrorists never acquire a nuclear weapon.
this is the most immediate and extreme threat to global security.
one terrorist with one nuclear weapon could unleash massive destruction.
al qaeda has said it seeks a bomb and that it would have no problem with using it.
and we know that there is unsecured nuclear material across the globe.
to protect our people, we must act with a sense of purpose without delay.
so today i am announcing a new international effort to secure all vulnerable nuclear material around the world within four years.
we will set new standards, expand our cooperation with russia, pursue new partnerships to lock down these sensitive materials.
we must also build on our efforts to break up black markets, detect and intercept materials in transit, and use financial tools to disrupt this dangerous trade.
because this threat will be lasting, we should come together to turn efforts such as the proliferation security initiative and the global initiative to combat nuclear terrorism into durable international institutions.
and we should start by having a global summit on nuclear security that the united states will host within the next year.
now, i know that there are some who will question whether we can act on such a broad agenda.
there are those who doubt whether true international cooperation is possible, given inevitable differences among nations.
and there are those who hear talk of a world without nuclear weapons and doubt whether it's worth setting a goal that seems impossible to achieve.
but make no mistake
: we know where that road leads.
when nations and peoples allow themselves to be defined by their differences, the gulf between them widens.
when we fail to pursue peace, then it stays forever beyond our grasp.
we know the path when we choose fear over hope.
to denounce or shrug off a call for cooperation is an easy but also a cowardly thing to do.
that's how wars begin.
that's where human progress ends.
there is violence and injustice in our world that must be confronted.
we must confront it not by splitting apart but by standing together as free nations, as free people.
i know that a call to arms can stir the souls of men and women more than a call to lay them down.
but that is why the voices for peace and progress must be raised together.
those are the voices that still echo through the streets of prague.
those are the ghosts of 1968.
those were the joyful sounds of the velvet revolution.
those were the czechs who helped bring down a nuclear-armed empire without firing a shot.
human destiny will be what we make of it.
and here in prague, let us honor our past by reaching for a better future.
let us bridge our divisions, build upon our hopes, accept our responsibility to leave this world more prosperous and more peaceful than we found it.
together we can do it.
thank you very much.
thank you, prague.
thank you so much.
good afternoon.
bon après-midi.
and guten tag.
it is a great honor for me to be here in europe, to be here in strasbourg.
i want to make just a few acknowledgements.
i want to thank the president of france, nicolas sarkozy, for being such a terrific friend.
i want to thank his wife, madam sarkozy.
they just hosted us at the palace and could not have been more gracious.
i want to thank the charge d'affaires, mark pekala, and his wife, maria, who were helping to organize us; vincent carver, who's the counsel general in strasbourg.
and i want to thank the mayor of strasbourg, roland ries, for his hospitality.
it is wonderful to be here with all of you and to have an opportunity not only to speak to you but also to take some questions.
you know, oftentimes during these foreign trips you see everything from behind a window, and what we thought was important
was for me to have an opportunity to not only speak with you but also to hear from you, because that's ultimately how we can learn about each other.
but before i take some questions, i hope you don't mind me making a few remarks about my country and yours;
the relationship between the united states and the relationship between europe.
strasbourg has been known throughout history as a city at the crossroads.
over thousands of years, you straddled many kingdoms and many cultures.
two rivers are joined here.
two religions have flourished in your churches.
three languages comprise an ancient oath that bears the city's name.
you served as a center of industry and commerce, a seat of government and education, where goethe studied and pasteur taught and
gutenberg imagined his printing press.
so it's fitting because we find ourselves at a crossroads as well -- all of us
-- for we've arrived at a moment where each nation and every citizen must choose at last how we respond to a world that has grown smaller and more connected than at any time in its existence.
we've known for a long time that the revolutions in communications and technology that took place in the 20th century would hold out enormous promise for the 21st century -- the promise of broader prosperity and mobility; of new breakthroughs and discoveries that could help us lead richer and fuller lives.
but the same forces that have brought us closer together have also given rise to new dangers that threaten to tear our world apart -- dangers that cannot be contained by the nearest border or the furthest ocean.
even with the cold war now over, the spread of nuclear weapons or the theft of nuclear material could lead to the extermination of any city on the planet.
and this weekend in prague, i will lay out an agenda to seek the goal of a world without nuclear weapons.
we also know that the pollution from cars in boston or from factories in beijing are melting the ice caps in the arctic, and that that will disrupt weather patterns everywhere.
the terrorists who struck in london, in new york, plotted in distant caves and simple apartments much closer to your home.
and the reckless speculation of bankers that has new fueled a global economic downturn that's inflicting pain on workers and families is happening everywhere all across the globe.
the economic crisis has proven the fact of our interdependence in the most visible way yet.
not more than a generation ago, it would have been difficult to imagine that the inability of somebody to pay for a house in florida could contribute to the failure of the banking system in iceland.
today what's difficult to imagine is that we did not act sooner to shape our future.
now, there's plenty of blame to go around for what has happened, and the united states certainly shares its -- shares blame for what has happened.
but every nation bears responsibility for what lies ahead, especially now, for whether it's the recession or climate change, or terrorism, or drug trafficking, poverty, or the proliferation of nuclear weapons, we have learned that without a doubt there's no quarter of the globe that can wall itself off from the threats of the 21st century.
the one way forward -- the only way forward -- is through a common and persistent effort to combat fear and want wherever they exist.
that is the challenge of our time -- and we can not fail to meet it, together.
now, we take for granted the peace of a europe that's united, but for centuries strasbourg has been attacked and occupied and claimed by the warring nations of this continent.
now, today in this city, the presence of the european parliament and the council of europe stand as symbols of a europe that is united peaceful and free.
now, we take this peace and prosperity for granted, but this destination was not easily reached, nor was it predestined.
the buildings that are now living monuments to european unity were not drawn from simple blueprints.
they were born out of the blood of the first half of the 20th century and the resolve of the second.
men and women had to have the imagination to see a better future, and the courage to reach for it.
europeans and americans had to have the sense of common purpose to join one another, and the patience and the persistence to see a long twilight struggle through.
it was 61 years ago this april that a marshall plan to rebuild europe helped to deliver hope to a continent that had been decimated by war.
amid the ashes and the rubble that surrounded so many cities like this one, america joined with you in an unprecedented effort that secured a lasting prosperity not just in europe, but around the world -- on both sides of the atlantic.
one year later, exactly 60 years ago tomorrow, we ensured our shared security when 12 of our nations signed a treaty in washington that spelled out a simple agreement: an attack on one would be viewed as an attack on all.
without firing a single shot, this alliance would prevent the iron curtain from descending on the free nations of western europe.
it would lead eventually to the crumbling of a wall in berlin and the end of the communist threat.
two decades later, with 28 member nations that stretched from the baltic to the mediterranean, nato remains the strongest alliance that the world has ever known.
at the crossroads where we stand today, this shared history gives us hope -- but it must not give us rest.
this generation cannot stand still.
we cannot be content merely to celebrate the achievements of the 20th century, or enjoy the comforts of the 21st century; we must learn from the past to build on its success.
we must renew our institutions, our alliances.
we must seek the solutions to the challenges of this young century.
this is our generation.
this is our time.
and i am confident that we can meet any challenge as long as we are together.
such an effort is never easy.
it's always harder to forge true partnerships and sturdy alliances than to act alone, or to wait for the action of somebody else.
it's more difficult to break down walls of division than to simply allow our differences to build and our resentments to fester.
so we must be honest with ourselves.
in recent years we've allowed our alliance to drift.
i know that there have been honest disagreements over policy, but we also know that there's something more that has crept into our relationship.
in america, there's a failure to appreciate europe's leading role in the world.
instead of celebrating your dynamic union and seeking to partner with you to meet common challenges, there have been times where america has shown arrogance and been dismissive, even derisive.
but in europe, there is an anti-americanism that is at once casual but can also be insidious.
instead of recognizing the good that america so often does in the world, there have been times where europeans choose to blame america for much of what's bad.
on both sides of the atlantic, these attitudes have become all too common.
they are not wise.
they do not represent the truth.
they threaten to widen the divide across the atlantic and leave us both more isolated.
they fail to acknowledge the fundamental truth that america cannot confront the challenges of this century alone, but that europe cannot confront them without america.
so i've come to europe this week to renew our partnership, one in which america listens and learns from our friends and allies, but where our friends and allies bear their share of the burden.
together, we must forge common solutions to our common problems.
so let me say this as clearly as i can: america is changing, but it cannot be america alone that changes.
we are confronting the greatest economic crisis since world war ii.
the only way to confront this unprecedented crisis is through unprecedented coordination.
over the last few days, i believe that we have begun that effort.
the g20 summit in london was a success of nations coming together, working out their differences, and moving boldly forward.
all of us are moving aggressively to restore growth and lending.
all of us have agreed to the most substantial overhaul of our international financial system in a generation.
no one is exempt.
no more will the world's financial players be able to make risky bets at the expense of ordinary people.
those days are over.
we are ushering a new era of responsibility, and that is something we should all be proud of.
as we take these steps, we also affirm that we must not erect new barriers to commerce; that trade wars have no victors.
we can't give up on open markets, even as we work to ensure that trade is both free and fair.
we cannot forget how many millions that trade has lifted out of poverty and into the middle class.
we can't forget that part of the freedom that our nations stood for throughout the cold war was the opportunity that comes from free enterprise and individual liberty.
i know it can be tempting to turn inward, and i understand how many people and nations have been left behind by the global economy.
and that's why the united states is leading an effort to reach out to people around the world who are suffering, to provide them immediate assistance and to extend support for food security that will help them lift themselves out of poverty.
all of us must join together in this effort, not just because it is right, but because by providing assistance to those countries most in need, we will provide new markets, we will drive the growth of the future that lifts all of us up.
so it's not just charity; it's a matter of understanding that our fates are tied together -- not just the fate of europe and america, but the fate of the entire world.
and as we restore our common prosperity, we must stand up for our common security.
as we meet here today, nato has still embarked on its first mission overseas in afghanistan, and my administration has just completed a review of our policy in that region.
now, i understand that this war has been long.
our allies have already contributed greatly to this endeavor.
you've sent your sons and daughters to fight alongside ours, and we honor and respect their service and sacrifice.
and i also know that there's some who have asked questions about why are we still in afghanistan?
what does this mean?
what's its purpose?
understand we would not deploy our own troops if this mission was not indispensable to our common security.
as president, i can tell you there's no decision more difficult, there's no duty more painful, than signing a letter to the family of somebody who has died in war.
so i understand that there is doubt about this war in europe.
there's doubt at times even in the united states.
but know this: the united states of america did not choose to fight a war in afghanistan.
we were attacked by an al qaeda network that killed thousands on american soil, including french and germans.
along the border of afghanistan and pakistan, those terrorists are still plotting today.
and they're -- if there is another al qaeda attack, it is just as likely, if not more, that it will be here in europe in a european city.
so i've made a commitment to afghanistan, and i've asked our nato partners for more civilian and military support and assistance.
we do this with a clear purpose: to root out the terrorists who threaten all of us, to train the afghan people to sustain their own security and to help them advance their own opportunity, and to quicken the day when our troops come home.
we have no interest in occupying afghanistan.
we have more than enough to do in rebuilding america.
but this is a mission that tests whether nations can come together in common purpose on behalf of our common security.
that's what we did together in the 20th century.
and now we need an alliance that is even stronger than when it brought down a mighty wall in berlin.
that's why we applaud france's decision to expand and deepen its participation in nato, just as we support a strong european defense.
that's why we welcome croatia and albania into the fold.
and that is why we must ensure that nato is equipped and capable of facing down the threats and challenges of this new age.
this is one of our central tasks.
and we also know that in the 21st century, security is more complex than military power.
this is the generation that must also stop the spread of the pollution that is slowly killing our planet, from shrinking coastlines and devastating storms to widespread misery and famine and drought.
the effects of climate change are now in plain sight.
europe has acted with a seriousness of purpose that this challenge demands.
and in the last few months i'm proud to say that america has begun to take unprecedented steps to transform the way that we use energy.
we appointed a special envoy to help us lead a global effort to reduce the carbon that we send in the atmosphere.
but we all know that time is running out.
and that means that america must do more.
europe must do more.
china and india must do more.
rolling back the tide of a warming planet is a responsibility that we have to ourselves, to our children, and all of those who will inherit god's creation long after we are gone.
so let us meet that responsibility together.
i am confident that we can meet it.
but we have to begin today.
and let us resolve that when future generations look back on ours, they will be able to say that we did our part to make this world more peaceful.
it's perhaps the most difficult work of all to resolve age-old conflicts, to heal ancient hatreds, to dissolve the lines of suspicion between religions and cultures, and people who may not look like us, or have the same faith that we do, or come from the same place.
but just because it's difficult does not make the work any less important.
it does not absolve us from trying.
and to that end, america will sustain our effort to forge and secure a lasting peace between the israelis and the palestinians.
i've sent a clear message to the leaders and peoples of iran that while we have real differences, we also have mutual interests, and we seek new engagement based on mutual respect.
and it is in that spirit that america and europe must reach out to the vast majority of muslims in our nations and in all nations.
we seek only hope of peace and partnership, and the opportunity of a better life.
we cannot simply solve these conflicts militarily.
we have to open our minds and we have to open our hearts to the differences among us and the commonalities between us.
with every threat that we face, a new day is possible.
we can't get there alone.
as it was in the darkest days after world war ii, when a continent lay in ruins and an atomic cloud had settled over the world, we must make the journey together.
we know that transformational change is possible.
we know this because of three reasons: first, because, for all our differences, there are certain values that bind us together and reveal our common humanity: the universal longing to live a life free from fear, and free from want; a life marked by dignity and respect and simple justice.
our two republics were founded in service of these ideals.
in america, it is written into our founding documents as "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."
in france: "liberté" -- absolutely -- "egalité, fraternité."
our moral authority is derived from the fact that generations of our citizens have fought and bled to uphold these values in our nations and others.
and that's why we can never sacrifice them for expedience's sake.
that's why i've ordered the closing of the detention center in guantanamo bay.
that's why i can stand here today and say without equivocation or exception that the united states of america does not and will not torture.
the second way that we can turn challenge into opportunity is through our persistence in the face of difficulty.
in an age of instant gratification, it's tempting to believe that every problem can and should be solved in the span of a week.
when these problems aren't solved, we conclude that our efforts to solve them must have been in vain.
but that's not how progress is made.
progress is slow.
it comes in fits and starts, because we try and we fail
and then we try something else.
and when there are setbacks and disappointments we keep going.
we hold firm to our core values, and we hold firm to our faith in one another.
the third reason we know that we can change this world is because of men and women like the young people who are here today.
each time we find ourselves at a crossroads, paralyzed by worn debates and stale thinking, the old ways of doing things, a new generation rises up and shows the way forward.
as robert kennedy once told a crowd of students in south africa, "it is a revolutionary world that we live in, and thus, it is young people who must take the lead."
because young people are unburdened by the biases or prejudices of the past.
that is a great privilege of youth.
but it's also a tremendous responsibility because it is you who must ultimately decide what we do with this incredible moment in history.
we just emerged from an era marked by irresponsibility, and it would be easy to choose the path of selfishness or apathy, of blame or division.
but that is a danger that we cannot afford.
the challenges are too great.
it is a revolutionary world that we live in, and history shows us that we can do improbable, sometimes impossible things.
we stand here in a city that used to stand at the center of european conflict; only now it is the center of european union.
we did that together.
now we must not give up on one another.
we must renew this relationship for a new generation, in a new century.
we must hold firm to our common values, hold firm to our faith in one another.
together, i'm confident that we can achieve the promise of a new day.
thank you very much.
thank you.
thank you very much.
thank you very much.
to general haley for the outstanding work he is doing.
thank you so much.
good morning marines.
good morning camp lejeune.
good morning jacksonville.
thank you for that outstanding welcome.
i want to thank lieutenant general hejlik for hosting me here today.
i also want to acknowledge all of our soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines serving in iraq and afghanistan.
that includes the camp lejeune marines now serving with – or soon joining – the second marine expeditionary force in iraq; those with special purpose marine air ground task force in afghanistan; and those among the 8,000 marines who are preparing to deploy to afghanistan.
we have you in our prayers.
we pay tribute to your service.
we thank you and your families for all that you do for america.
and i want all of you to know that there is no higher honor or greater responsibility than serving as your commander-in-chief.
i also want to take this opportunity to acknowledge ryan crocker, who recently completed his service as our ambassador to iraq.
throughout his career, ryan always took on the toughest assignments.
he is an example of the very best that this nation has to offer, and we owe him a great debt of gratitude.
he carried on his work with an extraordinary degree of cooperation with two of our finest generals – general david petraeus, and general ray odierno – who will be critical in carrying forward the strategy that i will outline today.
next month will mark the sixth anniversary of the war in iraq.
by any measure, this has already been a long war.
for the men and women of america’s armed forces – and for your families – this war has been one of the most extraordinary chapters of service in the history of our nation.
you have endured tour after tour after tour of duty.
you have known the dangers of combat and the lonely distance of loved ones.
you have fought against tyranny and disorder.
you have bled for your best friends and for unknown iraqis.
and you have borne an enormous burden for your fellow citizens, while extending a precious opportunity to the people of iraq.
under tough circumstances, the men and women of the united states military have served with honor, and succeeded beyond any expectation.
today, i have come to speak to you about how the war in iraq will end.
to understand where we need to go in iraq, it is important for the american people to understand where we now stand.
thanks in great measure to your service, the situation in iraq has improved.
violence has been reduced substantially from the horrific sectarian killing of 2006 and 2007.
al qaeda in iraq has been dealt a serious blow by our troops and iraq’s security forces, and through our partnership with sunni arabs.
the capacity of iraq’s security forces has improved, and iraq’s leaders have taken steps toward political accommodation.
the relative peace and strong participation in january’s provincial elections sent a powerful message to the world about how far iraqis have come in pursuing their aspirations through a peaceful political process.
but let there be no doubt: iraq is not yet secure, and there will be difficult days ahead.
violence will continue to be a part of life in iraq.
too many fundamental political questions about iraq’s future remain unresolved.
too many iraqis are still displaced or destitute.
declining oil revenues will put an added strain on a government that has had difficulty delivering basic services.
not all of iraq’s neighbors are contributing to its security.
some are working at times to undermine it.
and even as iraq’s government is on a surer footing, it is not yet a full partner – politically and economically – in the region, or with the international community

in short, today there is a renewed cause for hope in iraq, but that hope rests upon an emerging foundation.
on my first full day in office, i directed my national security team to undertake a comprehensive review of our strategy in iraq to determine the best way to strengthen that foundation, while strengthening american national security.
i have listened to my secretary of defense, the joint chiefs of staff, and commanders on the ground.
we have acted with careful consideration of events on the ground; with respect for the security agreements between the united states and iraq; and with a critical recognition that the long-term solution in iraq must be political – not military.
because the most important decisions that have to be made about iraq’s future must now be made by iraqis.
we have also taken into account the simple reality that america can no longer afford to see iraq in isolation from other priorities: we face the challenge of refocusing on afghanistan and pakistan; of relieving the burden on our military; and of rebuilding our struggling economy – and these are challenges that we will meet.
today, i can announce that our review is complete, and that the united states will pursue a new strategy to end the war in iraq through a transition to full iraqi responsibility.
this strategy is grounded in a clear and achievable goal shared by the iraqi people and the american people: an iraq that is sovereign, stable, and self-reliant.
to achieve that goal, we will work to promote an iraqi government that is just, representative, and accountable, and that provides neither support nor safe-haven to terrorists.
we will help iraq build new ties of trade and commerce with the world.
and we will forge a partnership with the people and government of iraq that contributes to the peace and security of the region.
what we will not do is let the pursuit of the perfect stand in the way of achievable goals.
we cannot rid iraq of all who oppose america or sympathize with our adversaries.
we cannot police iraq
’s streets until they are completely safe, nor stay until iraq
’s union is perfected.
we cannot sustain indefinitely a commitment that has put a strain on our military, and will cost the american people nearly a trillion dollars.
america’s men and women in uniform have fought block by block, province by province, year after year, to give the iraqis this chance to choose a better future.
now, we must ask the iraqi people to seize it.
the first part of this strategy is therefore the responsible removal of our combat brigades from iraq.
as a candidate for president, i made clear my support for a timeline of 16 months to carry out this drawdown, while pledging to consult closely with our military commanders upon taking office to ensure that we preserve the gains we’ve made and protect our troops.
those consultations are now complete, and i have chosen a timeline that will remove our combat brigades over the next 18 months.
let me say this as plainly as i can: by august 31, 2010, our combat mission in iraq will end.
as we carry out this drawdown, my highest priority will be the safety and security of our troops and civilians in iraq.
we will proceed carefully, and i will consult closely with my military commanders on the ground and with the iraqi government.
there will surely be difficult periods and tactical adjustments.
but our enemies should be left with no doubt: this plan gives our military the forces and the flexibility they need to support our iraqi partners, and to succeed.
after we remove our combat brigades, our mission will change from combat to supporting the iraqi government and its security forces as they take the absolute lead in securing their country.
as i have long said, we will retain a transitional force to carry out three distinct functions: training, equipping, and advising iraqi security forces as long as they remain non-sectarian; conducting targeted counter-terrorism missions; and protecting our ongoing civilian and military efforts within iraq.
initially, this force will likely be made up of 35-50,000 u.s. troops.
through this period of transition, we will carry out further redeployments.
and under the status of forces agreement with the iraqi government, i intend to remove all u.s. troops from iraq by the end of 2011.
we will complete this transition to iraqi responsibility, and we will bring our troops home with the honor that they have earned.
as we responsibly remove our combat brigades, we will pursue the second part of our strategy: sustained diplomacy on behalf of a more peaceful and prosperous iraq.
the drawdown of our military should send a clear signal that iraq’s future is now its own responsibility.
the long-term success of the iraqi nation will depend upon decisions made by iraq’s leaders and the fortitude of the iraqi people.
iraq is a sovereign country with legitimate institutions; america cannot – and should not – take their place.
however, a strong political, diplomatic, and civilian effort on our part can advance progress and help lay a foundation for lasting peace and security.
this effort will be led by our new ambassador to iraq – chris hill.
from his time in the peace corps, to his work in kosovo and korea, ambassador hill has been tested, and he has shown the pragmatism and skill that we need right now.
he will be supported by the courageous and capable work of so many american diplomats and aid workers who are serving in iraq.
going forward, we can make a difference on several fronts.
we will work with the united nations to support national elections, while helping iraqis improve local government.
we can serve as an honest broker in pursuit of fair and durable agreements on issues that have divided iraq’s leaders.
and just as we will support iraq’s security forces, we will help iraqi institutions strengthen their capacity to protect the rule of law, confront corruption, and deliver basic services.
diplomacy and assistance is also required to help the millions of displaced iraqis.
these men, women and children are a living consequence of this war and a challenge to stability in the region, and they must become a part of iraq’s reconciliation and recovery.
america has a strategic interest – and a moral responsibility – to act.
in the coming months, my administration will provide more assistance and take steps to increase international support for countries already hosting refugees; we’ll cooperate with others to resettle iraqis facing great personal risk; and we will work with the iraqi government over time to resettle refugees and displaced iraqis within iraq – because there are few more powerful indicators of lasting peace than displaced citizens returning home.
now, before i go any further, i want to take a moment to speak directly to the people of iraq.
you are a great nation, rooted in the cradle of civilization.
you are joined together by enduring accomplishments, and a history that connects you as surely as the two rivers carved into your land.
in years past, you have persevered through tyranny and terror; through personal insecurity and sectarian violence.
and instead of giving in to the forces of disunion, you stepped back from a descent into civil war, and showed a proud resilience that deserves respect.
our nations have known difficult times together.
but ours is a bond forged by shared bloodshed, and countless friendships among our people.
we americans have offered our most precious resource -- our young men and women -- to work with you to rebuild what was destroyed by despotism; to root out our common enemies; and to seek peace and prosperity for our children and grandchildren, and for yours.
there are those who will try to prevent that future for iraq – who will insist that iraq’s differences cannot be reconciled without more killing.
they represent the forces that destroy nations and lead only to despair, and they will test our will in the months and years to come.
america, too, has known these forces.
we endured the pain of civil war, and bitter divisions of region and race.
but hostility and hatred are no match for justice; they offer no pathway to peace; and they must not stand between the people of iraq and a future of reconciliation and hope.
so to the iraqi people, let me be clear about america
’s intentions.
the united states pursues no claim on your territory or your resources.
we respect your sovereignty and the tremendous sacrifices you have made for your country.
we seek a full transition to iraqi responsibility for the security of your country.
and going forward, we can build a lasting relationship founded upon mutual interests and mutual respect as iraq takes its rightful place in the community of nations.
that leads me to the third part of our strategy -- comprehensive american engagement across the region.
the future of iraq is inseparable from the future of the broader middle east, so we must work with our friends and partners to establish a new framework that advances iraq’s security and the region’s.
it is time for iraq to be a full partner in a regional dialogue, and for iraq
’s neighbors to establish productive and normalized relations with iraq.
and going forward, the united states will pursue principled and sustained engagement with all of the nations in the region, and that will include iran and syria.
this reflects a fundamental truth: we can no longer deal with regional challenges in isolation – we need a smarter, more sustainable and comprehensive approach.
that is why we are renewing our diplomacy, while relieving the burden on our military.
that is why we are refocusing on al qaeda in afghanistan and pakistan; developing a strategy to use all elements of american power to prevent iran from developing a nuclear weapon; and actively seeking a lasting peace between israel and the arab world.
and that is why we have named three of america’s most accomplished diplomats – george mitchell, dennis ross and richard holbrooke – to support secretary clinton and me as we carry forward this agenda.
every nation and every group must know -- whether you wish america good or ill -- that the end of the war in iraq will enable a new era of american leadership and engagement in the middle east.
and that era has just begun.
finally, i want to be very clear that my strategy for ending the war in iraq does not end with military plans or diplomatic agendas – it endures through our commitment to uphold our sacred trust with every man and woman who has served in iraq.
you make up a fraction of the american population, but in an age when so many people and institutions have acted irresponsibly, you did the opposite – you volunteered to bear the heaviest burden.
and for you and for your families, the war does not end when you come home.
it lives on in memories of your fellow soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines who gave their lives.
it endures in the wound that is slow to heal, the disability that isn’t going away, the dream that wakes you at night, or the stiffening in your spine when a car backfires down the street.
you and your families have done your duty – now a grateful nation must do ours.
that is why i am increasing the number of soldiers and marines, so that we lessen the burden on those who are serving.
and that is why i have committed to expanding our system of veterans health care to serve more patients, and to provide better care in more places.
we will continue building new wounded warrior facilities across america, and invest in new ways of identifying and treating the signature wounds of this war: post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury, as well as other combat injuries.
we also know that service does not end with the person wearing the uniform.
in her visits with military families across the country, my wife michelle has learned firsthand about the unique burden that your families endure every day.
i want you to know this: military families are a top priority for michelle and me, and they will be a top priority for my administration.
we’ll raise military pay, and continue providing quality child-care, job-training for spouses, and expanded counseling and outreach to families that have known the separation and stress of war.
we will also heed the lesson of history – that those who fight in battle can form the backbone of our middle class – by implementing a 21st century gi bill to help our veterans live their dreams.
as a nation, we have had our share of debates about the war in iraq.
it has, at times, divided us as a people.
to this very day, there are some americans who want to stay in iraq longer, and some who want to leave faster.
but there should be no disagreement on what the men and women of our military have achieved.
and so i want to be very clear: we sent our troops to iraq to do away with saddam hussein’s regime – and you got the job done.
we kept our troops in iraq to help establish a sovereign government – and you got the job done.
and we will leave the iraqi people with a hard-earned opportunity to live a better life –
that is your achievement; that is the prospect that you have made possible.
there are many lessons to be learned from what we’ve experienced.
we have learned that america must go to war with clearly defined goals, which is why i’ve ordered a review of our policy in afghanistan.
we have learned that we must always weigh the costs of action, and communicate those costs candidly to the american people, which is why i’ve put iraq and afghanistan into my budget.
we have learned that in the 21st century, we must use all elements of american power to achieve our objectives, which is why i am committed to building our civilian national security capacity so that the burden is not continually pushed on to our military.
we have learned that our political leaders must pursue the broad and bipartisan support that our national security policies depend upon, which is why i will consult with congress and in carrying out my plans.
and we have learned the importance of working closely with friends and allies, which is why we are launching a new era of engagement in the world.
the starting point for our policies must always be the safety of the american people.
i know that you – the men and women of the finest fighting force in the history of the world – can meet any challenge, and defeat any foe.
and as long as i am your commander-in-chief, i promise you that i will only send you into harm’s way when it is absolutely necessary, and provide you with the equipment and support you need to get the job done.
that is the most important lesson of all – for the consequences of war are dire, the sacrifices immeasurable.
you know because you have seen those sacrifices.
you have lived them.
and we all honor them.
"semper fidelis"
– it means always being faithful to corps, and to country, and to the memory of fallen comrades like corporal jonathan yale and lance corporal jordan haerter.
these young men enlisted in a time of war, knowing they would face great danger.
they came here, to camp lejeune, as they trained for their mission.
and last april, they were standing guard in anbar.
in an age when suicide is a weapon, they were suddenly faced with an oncoming truck filled with explosives.
these two marines stood their ground.
these two marines opened fire.
and these two marines stopped that truck.
when the thousands of pounds of explosives detonated, they had saved fifty marines and iraqi police who would have been in the truck’s path, but corporal yale and lance corporal haerter lost their own lives.
jonathan was 21.
jordan was 19.
in the town where jordan haerter was from, a bridge was dedicated in his name.
one marine who traveled to the ceremony said: "we flew here from all over the country to pay tribute to our friend jordan, who risked his life to save us.
we wouldn’t be here without him."
america’s
time in iraq is filled with stories of men and women like this.
their names are written into bridges and town squares.
they are etched into stones at arlington, and in quiet places of rest across our land.
they are spoken in schools and on city blocks.
they live on in the memories of those who wear your uniform, in the hearts of those they loved, and in the freedom of the nation they served.
each american who has served in iraq has their own story.
each of you has your own story.
and that story is now a part of the history of the united states of america – a nation that exists only because free men and women have bled for it from the beaches of normandy to the deserts of anbar; from the mountains of korea to the streets of kandahar.
you teach us that the price of freedom is great.
your sacrifice should challenge all of us – every single american – to ask what we can do to be better citizens.
there will be more danger in the months ahead.
we will face new tests and unforeseen trials.
but thanks to the sacrifices of those who have served, we have forged hard-earned progress, we are leaving iraq to its people, and we have begun the work of ending this war.
thank you, god bless you, and god bless the united states of america.
semper fi.
madame speaker, mr. vice president, members of congress, the first lady of the united states (who is around here somewhere):
i have come here tonight not only to address the distinguished men and women in this great chamber, but to speak frankly and directly to the men and women who sent us here.
i know that for many americans watching right now, the state of our economy is a concern that rises above all others.
and rightly so.
if you haven’t been personally affected by this recession, you probably know someone who has -- a friend; a neighbor; a member of your family.
you don’t need to hear another list of statistics to know that our economy is in crisis, because you live it every day.
it’s
the worry you wake up with and the source of sleepless nights.
it’s
the job you thought you’d retire from but now have lost; the business you built your dreams upon that’s now hanging by a thread; the college acceptance letter your child had to put back in the envelope.
the impact of this recession is real, and it is everywhere.
but while our economy may be weakened and our confidence shaken; though we are living through difficult and uncertain times, tonight i want every american to know this:

we will rebuild, we will recover, and the united states of america will emerge stronger than before.
the weight of this crisis will not determine the destiny of this nation.
the answers to our problems don’t lie beyond our reach.
they exist in our laboratories and universities; in our fields and our factories; in the imaginations of our entrepreneurs and the pride of the hardest-working people on earth.
those qualities that have made america the greatest force of progress and prosperity in human history we still possess in ample measure.
what is required now is for this country to pull together, confront boldly the challenges we face, and take responsibility for our future once more.
now, if we’re honest with ourselves, we’ll admit that for too long, we have not always met these responsibilities -- as a government or as a people.
i say this not to lay blame or look backwards, but because it is only by understanding how we arrived at this moment that we’ll be able to lift ourselves out of this predicament.
the fact is, our economy did not fall into decline overnight.  nor did all of our problems begin when the housing market collapsed or the stock market sank.
we have known for decades that our survival depends on finding new sources of energy.
yet we import more oil today than ever before.
the cost of health care eats up more and more of our savings each year, yet we keep delaying reform.
our children will compete for jobs in a global economy that too many of our schools do not prepare them for.
and though all these challenges went unsolved, we still managed to spend more money and pile up more debt, both as individuals and through our government, than ever before.
in other words, we have lived through an era where too often, short-term gains were prized over long-term prosperity; where we failed to look beyond the next payment, the next quarter, or the next election.
a surplus became an excuse to transfer wealth to the wealthy instead of an opportunity to invest in our future.
regulations were gutted for the sake of a quick profit at the expense of a healthy market.
people bought homes
they knew they couldn’t afford from banks and lenders who pushed those bad loans anyway.
and all the while, critical debates and difficult decisions were put off for some other time on some other day.
well that day of reckoning has arrived, and the time to take charge of our future is here.
now is the time to act boldly and wisely -- to not only revive this economy, but to build a new foundation for lasting prosperity.
now is the time to jumpstart job creation, re-start lending, and invest in areas like energy, health care, and education that will grow our economy, even as we make hard choices to bring our deficit down.
that is what my economic agenda is designed to do, and that’s what i’d like to talk to you about tonight.
it’s an agenda that begins with jobs.
as soon as i took office, i asked this congress to send me a recovery plan by president’s day that would put people back to work and put money in their pockets.
not because i believe in bigger government – i don’t.
not because i’m not mindful of the massive debt we’ve inherited – i am.
i called for action because the failure to do so would have cost more jobs and caused more hardships.
in fact, a failure to act would have worsened our long-term deficit by assuring weak economic growth for years.
that’s why i pushed for quick action.
and tonight, i am grateful that this congress delivered, and pleased to say that the american recovery and reinvestment act is now law.
over the next two years, this plan will save or create 3.5 million jobs.
more than 90% of these jobs will be in the private sector – jobs rebuilding our roads and bridges; constructing wind turbines and solar panels; laying broadband and expanding mass transit.
because of this plan, there are teachers who can now keep their jobs and educate our kids.
health care professionals can continue caring for our sick.
there are 57 police officers who are still on the streets of minneapolis tonight because this plan prevented the layoffs their department was about to make.
because of this plan, 95% of the working households in america will receive a tax cut -- a tax cut that you will see in your paychecks beginning on april 1st.
because of this plan, families who are struggling to pay tuition costs will receive a $2,500 tax credit for all four years of college.
and americans who have lost their jobs in this recession will be able to receive extended unemployment benefits and continued health care coverage to help them weather this storm.
i know there are some in this chamber and watching at home who are skeptical of whether this plan will work.
i understand that skepticism.
here in washington, we’ve all seen how quickly good intentions can turn into broken promises and wasteful spending.
and with a plan of this scale comes enormous responsibility to get it right.
that is why i have asked vice president biden to lead a tough, unprecedented oversight effort – because nobody messes with joe.
i have told each member of my cabinet as well as mayors and governors across the country that they will be held accountable by me and the american people for every dollar they spend.
i have appointed a proven and aggressive inspector general to ferret out any and all cases of waste and fraud.
and we have created a new website called recovery.gov so that every american can find out how and where their money is being spent.
so the recovery plan we passed is the first step in getting our economy back on track.
but it is just the first step.
because even if we manage this plan flawlessly, there will be no real recovery unless we clean up the credit crisis that has severely weakened our financial system.
i want to speak plainly and candidly about this issue tonight, because every american should know that it directly affects you and your family’s well-being.
you should also know that the money you’ve deposited in banks across the country is safe; your insurance is secure; and you can rely on the continued operation of our financial system.
that is not the source of concern.
the concern is that if we do not re-start lending in this country, our recovery will be choked off before it even begins.
you see, the flow of credit is the lifeblood of our economy.
the ability to get a loan is how you finance the purchase of everything from a home to a car to a college education; how stores stock their shelves, farms buy equipment, and businesses make payroll.
but credit has stopped flowing the way it should.
too many bad loans from the housing crisis have made their way onto the books of too many banks.
with so much debt and so little confidence, these banks are now fearful of lending out any more money to households, to businesses, or to each other.
when there is no lending, families can’t afford to buy homes or cars.
so businesses are forced to make layoffs.
our economy suffers even more, and credit dries up even further.
that is why this administration is moving swiftly and aggressively to break this destructive cycle, restore confidence, and re-start lending.
we will do so in several ways.
first, we are creating a new lending fund that represents the largest effort ever to help provide auto loans, college loans, and small business loans to the consumers and entrepreneurs who keep this economy running.
second, we have launched a housing plan that will help responsible families facing the threat of foreclosure lower their monthly payments and re-finance their mortgages.
it’s
a plan that won’t help speculators or that neighbor down the street who bought a house he could never hope to afford, but it will help millions of americans who are struggling with declining home values – americans who will now be able to take advantage of the lower interest rates that this plan has already helped bring about.
in fact, the average family who re-finances today can save nearly $2000 per year on their mortgage.
third, we will act with the full force of the federal government to ensure that the major banks that americans depend on have enough confidence and enough money to lend even in more difficult times.
and when we learn that a major bank has serious problems, we will hold accountable those responsible, force the necessary adjustments, provide the support to clean up their balance sheets, and assure the continuity of a strong, viable institution that can serve our people and our economy.
i understand that on any given day, wall street may be more comforted by an approach that gives banks bailouts with no strings attached, and that holds nobody accountable for their reckless decisions.
but such an approach won’t solve the problem.
and our goal is to quicken the day when we re-start lending to the american people and american business and end this crisis once and for all.
i intend to hold these banks fully accountable for the assistance they receive, and this time, they will have to clearly demonstrate how taxpayer dollars result in more lending for the american taxpayer.
this time, ceos won’t be able to use taxpayer money to pad their paychecks or buy fancy drapes or disappear on a private jet.
those days are over.
still, this plan will require significant resources from the federal government – and yes, probably more than we’ve already set aside.
but while the cost of action will be great, i can assure you that the cost of inaction will be far greater, for it could result in an economy that sputters along for not months or years, but perhaps a decade.
that would be worse for our deficit, worse for business, worse for you, and worse for the next generation.
and i refuse to let that happen.
i understand that when the last administration asked this congress to provide assistance for struggling banks, democrats and republicans alike were infuriated by the mismanagement and results that followed.
so were the american taxpayers.
so was i.
so i know how unpopular it is to be seen as helping banks right now, especially when everyone is suffering in part from their bad decisions.
i promise you – i get it.
but i also know that in a time of crisis, we cannot afford to govern out of anger, or yield to the politics of the moment.
my job – our job – is to solve the problem.
our job is to govern with a sense of responsibility.
i will not spend a single penny for the purpose of rewarding a single wall street executive, but i will do whatever it takes to help the small business that can’t pay its workers or the family that has saved and still can’t get a mortgage.
that’s what this is about.
it’s not about helping banks –
it’s about helping people.
because when credit is available again, that young family can finally buy a new home.
and then some company will hire workers to build it.
and then those workers will have money to spend, and if they can get a loan too, maybe they’ll finally buy that car, or open their own business.
investors will return to the market, and american families will see their retirement secured once more.
slowly, but surely, confidence will return, and our economy will recover.
so i ask this congress to join me in doing whatever proves necessary.
because we cannot consign our nation to an open-ended recession.
and to ensure that a crisis of this magnitude never happens again, i ask congress to move quickly on legislation that will finally reform our outdated regulatory system.
it is time to put in place tough, new common-sense rules of the road so that our financial market rewards drive and innovation, and punishes short-cuts and abuse.
the recovery plan and the financial stability plan are the immediate steps we’re taking to revive our economy in the short-term.
but the only way to fully restore america’s economic strength is to make the long-term investments that will lead to new jobs, new industries, and a renewed ability to compete with the rest of the world.
the only way this century will be another american century is if we confront at last the price of our dependence on oil and the high cost of health care; the schools that aren’t preparing our children and the mountain of debt they stand to inherit.
that is our responsibility.
in the next few days, i will submit a budget to congress.
so often, we have come to view these documents as simply numbers on a page or laundry lists of programs.
i see this document differently.
i see it as a vision for america – as a blueprint for our future.
my budget does not attempt to solve every problem or address every issue.
it reflects the stark reality of what we’ve inherited – a trillion dollar deficit, a financial crisis, and a costly recession.
given these realities, everyone in this chamber – democrats and republicans – will have to sacrifice some worthy priorities for which there are no dollars.
and that includes me.
but that does not mean we can afford to ignore our long-term challenges.
i reject the view that says our problems will simply take care of themselves; that says government has no role in laying the foundation for our common prosperity.
for history tells a different story.
history reminds us that at every moment of economic upheaval and transformation, this nation has responded with bold action and big ideas.
in the midst of civil war, we laid railroad tracks from one coast to another that spurred commerce and industry.
from the turmoil of the industrial revolution came a system of public high schools that prepared our citizens for a new age.
in the wake of war and depression, the gi bill sent a generation to college and created the largest middle-class in history.
and a twilight struggle for freedom led to a nation of highways, an american on the moon, and an explosion of technology that still shapes our world.
in each case, government didn’t supplant private enterprise; it catalyzed private enterprise.
it created the conditions for thousands of entrepreneurs and new businesses to adapt and to thrive.
we are a nation that has seen promise amid peril, and claimed opportunity from ordeal.
now we must be that nation again.
that is why, even as it cuts back on the programs we don’t need, the budget i submit will invest in the three areas that are absolutely critical to our economic future:  energy, health care, and education.
it begins with energy.
we know the country that harnesses the power of clean, renewable energy will lead the 21st century.
and yet, it is china that has launched the largest effort in history to make their economy energy efficient.
we invented solar technology, but we’ve fallen behind countries like germany and japan in producing it.
new plug-in hybrids roll off our assembly lines, but they will run on batteries made in korea.
well i do not accept a future where the jobs and industries of tomorrow take root beyond our borders – and
i know you don’t either.
it is time for america to lead again.
thanks to our recovery plan, we will double this nation’s supply of renewable energy in the next three years.
we have also made the largest investment in basic research funding in american history – an investment that will spur not only new discoveries in energy, but breakthroughs in medicine, science, and technology.
we will soon lay down thousands of miles of power lines that can carry new energy to cities and towns across this country.
and we will put americans to work making our homes and buildings more efficient so that we can save billions of dollars on our energy bills.
but to truly transform our economy, protect our security, and save our planet from the ravages of climate change, we need to ultimately make clean, renewable energy the profitable kind of energy.
so i ask this congress to send me legislation that places a market-based cap on carbon pollution and drives the production of more renewable energy in america.
and to support that innovation, we will invest fifteen billion dollars a year to develop technologies like wind power and solar power; advanced biofuels, clean coal, and more fuel-efficient cars and trucks built right here in america.
as for our auto industry, everyone recognizes that years of bad decision-making and a global recession have pushed our automakers to the brink.
we should not, and will not, protect them from their own bad practices.
but we are committed to the goal of a re-tooled, re-imagined auto industry that can compete and win.
millions of jobs depend on it.
scores of communities depend on it.
and i believe the nation that invented the automobile cannot walk away from it.
none of this will come without cost, nor will it be easy.
but this is america.
we don’t do what’s easy.
we do what is necessary to move this country forward.
for that same reason, we must also address the crushing cost of health care.
this is a cost that now causes a bankruptcy in america every thirty seconds.
by the end of the year, it could cause 1.5 million americans to lose their homes.
in the last eight years, premiums have grown four times faster than wages.
and in each of these years, one million more americans have lost their health insurance.
it is one of the major reasons why small businesses close their doors and corporations ship jobs overseas.
and it’s
one of the largest and fastest-growing parts of our budget.
given these facts, we can no longer afford to put health care reform on hold.
already, we have done more to advance the cause of health care reform in the last thirty days than we have in the last decade.
when it was days old, this congress passed a law to provide and protect health insurance for eleven million american children whose parents work full-time.
our recovery plan will invest in electronic health records and new technology that will reduce errors, bring down costs, ensure privacy, and save lives.
it will launch a new effort to conquer a disease that has touched the life of nearly every american by seeking a cure for cancer in our time.
and it makes the largest investment ever in preventive care, because that is one of the best ways to keep our people healthy and our costs under control.
this budget builds on these reforms.
it includes an historic commitment to comprehensive health care reform – a down-payment on the principle that we must have quality, affordable health care for every american.
it’s a commitment that’s paid for in part by efficiencies in our system that are long overdue.
and it’s a step we must take if we hope to bring down our deficit in the years to come.
now, there will be many different opinions and ideas about how to achieve reform, and that is why i’m bringing together businesses and workers, doctors and health care providers, democrats and republicans to begin work on this issue next week.
i suffer no illusions that this will be an easy process.
it will be hard.
but i also know that nearly a century after teddy roosevelt first called for reform, the cost of our health care has weighed down our economy and the conscience of our nation long enough.
so let there be no doubt: health care reform cannot wait, it must not wait, and it will not wait another year.
the third challenge we must address is the urgent need to expand the promise of education in america.
in a global economy where the most valuable skill you can sell is your knowledge, a good education is no longer just a pathway to opportunity – it is a pre-requisite.
right now, three-quarters of the fastest-growing occupations require more than a high school diploma.
and yet, just over half of our citizens have that level of education.
we have one of the highest high school dropout rates of any industrialized nation.
and half of the students who begin college never finish.
this is a prescription for economic decline, because we know the countries that out-teach us today will out-compete us tomorrow.
that is why it will be the goal of this administration to ensure that every child has access to a complete and competitive education – from the day they are born to the day they begin a career.
already, we have made an historic investment in education through the economic recovery plan.
we have dramatically expanded early childhood education and will continue to improve its quality, because we know that the most formative learning comes in those first years of life.
we have made college affordable for nearly seven million more students.
and we have provided the resources necessary to prevent painful cuts and teacher layoffs that would set back our children’s progress.
but we know that our schools don’t just need more resources.
they need more reform.
that is why this budget creates new incentives for teacher performance; pathways for advancement, and rewards for success.
we’ll invest in innovative programs that are already helping schools meet high standards and close achievement gaps.
and we will expand our commitment to charter schools.
it is our responsibility as lawmakers and educators to make this system work.
but it is the responsibility of every citizen to participate in it.
and so tonight, i ask every american to commit to at least one year or more of higher education or career training.
this can be community college or a four-year school; vocational training or an apprenticeship.
but whatever the training may be, every american will need to get more than a high school diploma.
and dropping out of high school is no longer an option.
it’s not just quitting on yourself,
it’s quitting on your country – and this country needs and values the talents of every american.
that is why we will provide the support necessary for you to complete college and meet a new goal:  by 2020, america will once again have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world.
i know that the price of tuition is higher than ever, which is why if you are willing to volunteer in your neighborhood or give back to your community or serve your country, we will make sure that you can afford a higher education.
and to encourage a renewed spirit of national service for this and future generations, i ask this congress to send me the bipartisan legislation that bears the name of senator orrin hatch as well as an american who has never stopped asking what he can do for his country – senator edward kennedy.
these education policies will open the doors of opportunity for our children.
but it is up to us to ensure they walk through them.
in the end, there is no program or policy that can substitute for a mother or father who will attend those parent/teacher conferences, or help with homework after dinner, or turn off the tv, put away the video games, and read to their child.
i speak to you not just as a president, but as a father when i say that responsibility for our children's education must begin at home.
there is, of course, another responsibility we have to our children.
and that is the responsibility to ensure that we do not pass on to them a debt they cannot pay.
with the deficit we inherited, the cost of the crisis we face, and the long-term challenges we must meet, it has never been more important to ensure that as our economy recovers, we do what it takes to bring this deficit down.
i’m proud that we passed the recovery plan free of earmarks, and i want to pass a budget next year that ensures that each dollar we spend reflects only our most important national priorities.
yesterday, i held a fiscal summit where i pledged to cut the deficit in half by the end of my first term in office.
my administration has also begun to go line by line through the federal budget in order to eliminate wasteful and ineffective programs.
as you can imagine, this is a process that will take some time.
but we’re starting with the biggest lines.
we have already identified two trillion dollars in savings over the next decade.
in this budget, we will end education programs that don’t work and end direct payments to large agribusinesses that don’t need them.
we’ll eliminate the no-bid contracts that have wasted billions in iraq, and reform our defense budget so that we’re not paying for cold war-era weapons systems we don’t use.
we will root out the waste, fraud, and abuse in our medicare program that doesn’t make our seniors any healthier, and we will restore a sense of fairness and balance to our tax code by finally ending the tax breaks for corporations that ship our jobs overseas.
in order to save our children from a future of debt, we will also end the tax breaks for the wealthiest 2% of americans.
but let me perfectly clear, because i know you’ll hear the same old claims that rolling back these tax breaks means a massive tax increase on the american people:  if your family earns less than $250,000 a year, you will not see your taxes increased a single dime.
i repeat: not one single dime.
in fact, the recovery plan provides a tax cut – that’s right, a tax cut – for 95% of working families.
and these checks are on the way.
to preserve our long-term fiscal health, we must also address the growing costs in medicare and social security.
comprehensive health care reform is the best way to strengthen medicare for years to come.
and we must also begin a conversation on how to do the same for social security, while creating tax-free universal savings accounts for all americans.
finally, because we’re also suffering from a deficit of trust, i am committed to restoring a sense of honesty and accountability to our budget.
that is why this budget looks ahead ten years and accounts for spending that was left out under the old rules – and for the first time, that includes the full cost of fighting in iraq and afghanistan.
for seven years, we have been a nation at war.
no longer will we hide its price.
we are now carefully reviewing our policies in both wars, and i will soon announce a way forward in iraq that leaves iraq to its people and responsibly ends this war.
and with our friends and allies, we will forge a new and comprehensive strategy for afghanistan and pakistan to defeat al qaeda and combat extremism.
because i will not allow terrorists to plot against the american people from safe havens half a world away.
as we meet here tonight, our men and women in uniform stand watch abroad and more are readying to deploy.
to each and every one of them, and to the families who bear the quiet burden of their absence, americans are united in sending one message: we honor your service, we are inspired by your sacrifice, and you have our unyielding support.
to relieve the strain on our forces, my budget increases the number of our soldiers and marines.
and to keep our sacred trust with those who serve, we will raise their pay, and give our veterans the expanded health care and benefits that they have earned.
to overcome extremism, we must also be vigilant in upholding the values our troops defend – because there is no force in the world more powerful than the example of america.
that is why i have ordered the closing of the detention center at guantanamo bay, and will seek swift and certain justice for captured terrorists – because living our values doesn’t make us weaker, it makes us safer and it makes us stronger.
and that is why i can stand here tonight and say without exception or equivocation that the united states of america does not torture.
in words and deeds, we are showing the world that a new era of engagement has begun.
for we know that america cannot meet the threats of this century alone, but the world cannot meet them without america.
we cannot shun the negotiating table, nor ignore the foes or forces that could do us harm.
we are instead called to move forward with the sense of confidence and candor that serious times demand.
to seek progress toward a secure and lasting peace between israel and her neighbors, we have appointed an envoy to sustain our effort.
to meet the challenges of the 21st century – from terrorism to nuclear proliferation; from pandemic disease to cyber threats to crushing poverty – we will strengthen old alliances, forge new ones, and use all elements of our national power.
and to respond to an economic crisis that is global in scope, we are working with the nations of the g-20 to restore confidence in our financial system, avoid the possibility of escalating protectionism, and spur demand for american goods in markets across the globe.
for the world depends on us to have a strong economy, just as our economy depends on the strength of the world’s.
as we stand at this crossroads of history, the eyes of all people in all nations are once again upon us – watching to see what we do with this moment; waiting for us to lead.
those of us gathered here tonight have been called to govern in extraordinary times.
it is a tremendous burden, but also a great privilege – one that has been entrusted to few generations of americans.
for in our hands lies the ability to shape our world for good or for ill.
i know that it is easy to lose sight of this truth – to become cynical and doubtful; consumed with the petty and the trivial.
but in my life, i have also learned that hope is found in unlikely places; that inspiration often comes not from those with the most power or celebrity, but from the dreams and aspirations of americans who are anything but ordinary.
i think about leonard abess, the bank president from miami who reportedly cashed out of his company, took a $60 million bonus, and gave it out to all 399 people who worked for him, plus another 72 who used to work for him.
he didn’t tell anyone, but when the local newspaper found out, he simply said, ''i knew some of these people since i was 7 years old.
i didn't feel right getting the money myself.
"
i think about greensburg, kansas, a town that was completely destroyed by a tornado, but is being rebuilt by its residents as a global example of how clean energy can power an entire community – how it can bring jobs and businesses to a place where piles of bricks and rubble once lay.
"the tragedy was terrible," said one of the men who helped them rebuild.
"but the folks here know that it also provided an incredible opportunity.
"
and i think about ty’sheoma bethea, the young girl from that school i visited in dillon, south carolina – a place where the ceilings leak, the paint peels off the walls, and they have to stop teaching six times a day because the train barrels by their classroom.
she has been told that her school is hopeless, but the other day after class she went to the public library and typed up a letter to the people sitting in this room.
she even asked her principal for the money to buy a stamp.
the letter asks us for help, and says, "we are just students trying to become lawyers, doctors, congressmen like yourself and one day president, so we can make a change to not just the state of south carolina but also the world.
we are not quitters.
"
we are not quitters.
these words and these stories tell us something about the spirit of the people who sent us here.
they tell us that even in the most trying times, amid the most difficult circumstances, there is a generosity, a resilience, a decency, and a determination that perseveres; a willingness to take responsibility for our future and for posterity.
their resolve must be our inspiration.
their concerns must be our cause.
and we must show them and all our people that we are equal to the task before us.
i know that we haven’t agreed on every issue thus far, and there are surely times in the future when we will part ways.
but i also know that every american who is sitting here tonight loves this country and wants it to succeed.
that must be the starting point for every debate we have in the coming months, and where we return after those debates are done.
that is the foundation on which the american people expect us to build common ground.
and if we do – if we come together and lift this nation from the depths of this crisis; if we put our people back to work and restart the engine of our prosperity; if we confront without fear the challenges of our time and summon that enduring spirit of an america that does not quit, then someday years from now our children can tell their children that this was the time when we performed, in the words that are carved into this very chamber, "something worthy to be remembered.
"
thank you, god bless you, and may god bless the united states of america.
thank you.
pease, be seated.
thank you, very much.
madam speaker, leader reid, members of congress, dear friends, former colleagues:
it is a great honor to be here -- a place where lincoln served, was inaugurated, and where the nation he saved bid him a last farewell.
as we mark the bicentennial of our 16th president's birth, i cannot claim to know as much about his life and works as many who are also speaking today, but i can say that i feel a special gratitude to this singular figure who in so many ways made my own story possible -- and in so many ways made america's story possible.
it is fitting that we are holding this celebration here at the capitol, for the life of this building is bound ever so closely to the times of this immortal president.
built by artisans and craftsmen, but also immigrants and slaves, it was here, in the rotunda, that union soldiers received help from a makeshift hospital; it was downstairs, in the basement, that they were baked bread to give them strength; and it was in the senate and house chambers where they slept at night and spent some of their days.
what those soldiers saw when they looked on this building was a very different sight than the one we see today, for it remained unfinished until the end of the war.
the laborers who built the dome came to work wondering each day whether that would be their last; whether the metal they were using for its frame would be requisitioned for the war and melted down into bullets.
but each day went by without any orders to halt construction, and so they kept on working, and kept on building.
and when president lincoln was finally told of all the metal being used here, his response was short and clear: that is as it should be.
the american people needed to be reminded, he believed, that even in a time of war, the work would go on; the people's business would continue; that even when the nation itself was in doubt, its future was being secured; and that on that distant day, when the guns fell silent, a national capitol would stand, with a statue of freedom at its peak, as a symbol of unity in a land still mending its divisions.
it is this sense of unity, this ability to plan for a shared future even at a moment where our nation was torn apart, that i reflect on today.
and while there are any number of moments that reveal that particular side of this extraordinary man, abraham lincoln -- that particular aspect of his leadership -- there's one that i'd like to share with you today.
in the war's final weeks, aboard grant's flagship, the river queen, president lincoln was asked what was to be done with the rebel armies once general lee surrendered.
with victory at hand, lincoln could have sought revenge.
he could have forced the south to pay a steep price for their rebellion.
but despite all the bloodshed and all the misery that each side had exacted upon the other, and despite his absolute certainty in the rightness of the cause of ending slavery, no confederate soldier was to be punished, lincoln ordered.
they were to be treated, as he put it, "liberally all round.
" what lincoln wanted was for confederate troops to go back home and return to work on their farms and in their shops.
he was even willing, he said, to "let them have their horses to plow and their guns to shoot crows with."
that was the only way, lincoln knew, to repair the rifts that had torn this country apart.
it was the only way to begin the healing that our nation so desperately needed.
what lincoln never forgot, not even in the midst of civil war, was that despite all that divides us -- north and south, black and white -- we were, at heart, one nation and one people, sharing a bond as americans that could bend but would not break.
and so even as we meet here today, in a moment when we are far less divided than in lincoln's day, but when we are once again debating the critical issues of our time -- and debating them sometimes fiercely -- let us remember that we are doing so as servants of the same flag, as representatives of the same people, and as stakeholders in a common future.
that is the most fitting tribute we can pay -- the most lasting monument we can build -- to that most remarkable of men, abraham lincoln.
thank you.
thank you, tim, for your hard work on this issue and on our economic recovery.
the economic crisis we face is unlike any we've seen in our lifetime.
it's a crisis of falling confidence and rising debt, of widely distributed risk and narrowly concentrated reward; a crisis written in the fine print of sub-prime mortgages, on the ledger lines of once mighty financial institutions, and on the pink slips that have upended the lives of so many people across this country and cost the economy 2.6 million jobs last year alone.
we know that even if we do everything that we should, this crisis was years in the making, and it will take more than weeks or months to turn things around.
but make no mistake: a failure to act, and act now, will turn crisis into a catastrophe and guarantee a longer recession, a less robust recovery, and a more uncertain future.
millions more jobs will be lost.
more businesses will be shuttered.
more dreams will be deferred.
and that's why i feel such a sense of urgency about the economic recovery and reinvestment plan that is before congress today.
with it, we can save or create more than three million jobs, doing things that will strengthen our country for years to come.
it's not merely a prescription for short-term spending -- it's a strategy for long-term economic growth in areas like renewable energy and health care and education.
now, in the past few days i've heard criticisms that this plan is somehow wanting, and these criticisms echo the very same failed economic theories that led us into this crisis in the first place -- the notion that tax cuts alone will solve all our problems; that we can ignore fundamental challenges like energy independence and the high cost of health care; that we can somehow deal with this in a piecemeal fashion and still expect our economy and our country to thrive.
i reject those theories.
and so did the american people when they went to the polls in november and voted resoundingly for change.
so i urge members of congress to act without delay.
no plan is perfect, and we should work to make it stronger.
no one is more committed to making it stronger than me.
but let's not make the perfect the enemy of the essential.
let's show people all over the country who are looking for leadership in this difficult time that we are equal to the task.
at the same time, we know that this recovery and reinvestment plan is only the first part of what we need to do to restore prosperity and secure our future.
we also need a strong and viable financial system to keep credit flowing to businesses and families alike.
and my administration will do whatever it takes to restore our financial system.
our recovery depends on it.
and so in the next week, secretary geithner will release a new strategy to get credit moving again -- a strategy that will reflect some of the lessons of past mistakes while laying the foundation of the future.
but in order to restore trust in our financial system, we're going to have to do more than just put forward our plans.
in order to restore trust, we've got to make certain that taxpayer funds are not subsidizing excessive compensation packages on wall street.
we all need to take responsibility.
and this includes executives at major financial firms who turned to the american people, hat in hand, when they were in trouble, even as they paid themselves customary lavish bonuses.
as i said last week, this is the height of irresponsibility.
it's shameful.
and that's exactly the kind of disregard of the costs and consequences of their actions that brought about this crisis:
a culture of narrow self-interest and short-term gain at the expense of everything else.
this is america.
we don't disparage wealth.
we don't begrudge anybody for achieving success.
and we certainly believe that success should be rewarded.
but what gets people upset -- and rightfully so
-- are executives being rewarded for failure, especially when those rewards are subsidized by u.s. taxpayers, many of whom are having a tough time themselves.
for top executives to award themselves these kinds of compensation packages in the midst of this economic crisis isn't just bad taste -- it's bad strategy -- and i will not tolerate it as president.
we're going to be demanding some restraint in exchange for federal aid -- so that when firms seek new federal dollars, we won't find them up to the same old tricks.
as part of the reforms we're announcing today, top executives at firms receiving extraordinary help from u.s. taxpayers will have their compensation capped at 500,000 dollars --
a fraction of the salaries that have been reported recently.
and if these executives receive any additional compensation, it will come in the form of stock that can't be paid up until taxpayers are paid back for their assistance.
companies receiving federal aid are going to have to disclose publicly all the perks and luxuries bestowed upon senior executives, and provide an explanation to the taxpayers and to shareholders as to why these expenses are justified.
and we're putting a stop to these kinds of massive severance packages we've all read about with disgust; we're taking the air out of golden parachutes.
we're asking these firms to take responsibility, to recognize the nature of this crisis and their role in it.
we believe that what we've laid out should be viewed as fair and embraced as basic common sense.
and finally, these guidelines we're putting in place are only the beginning of a long-term effort.
we're going to examine the ways in which the means and manner of executive compensation have contributed to a reckless culture and a quarter-by-quarter mentality that in turn helped to wrought havoc in our financial system.
we're going to be taking a look at broader reforms so that executives are compensated for sound risk management, and rewarded for growth measured over years, not just days or weeks.
we all have to pull together and take our share of responsibility.
that's true here in washington.
that's true on wall street.
the american people are carrying a huge burden as a result of this economic crisis: bearing the brunt of its effects as well as the cost of extraordinary measures we're taking to address them.
the american people expect and demand that we pursue policies that reflect the reality of this crisis -- and that will prevent these kinds of crises from occurring again in the future.
thank you very much.
we begin this year and this administration in the midst of an unprecedented crisis that calls for unprecedented action.
just this week, we saw more people file for unemployment than at any time in the last twenty-six years, and experts agree that if nothing is done, the unemployment rate could reach double digits.
our economy could fall $1 trillion short of its full capacity, which translates into more than $12,000 in lost income for a family of four.
and we could lose a generation of potential, as more young americans are forced to forgo college dreams or the chance to train for the jobs of the future.
in short, if we do not act boldly and swiftly, a bad situation could become dramatically worse.
that is why i have proposed an american recovery and reinvestment plan to immediately jumpstart job creation as well as long-term economic growth.
i am pleased to say that both parties in congress are already hard at work on this plan, and i hope to sign it into law in less than a month.
it’s a plan that will save or create three to four million jobs over the next few years, and one that recognizes both the paradox and the promise of this moment -- the fact that there are millions of americans trying to find work even as, all around the country, there’s so much work to be done.
that’s why this is not just a short-term program to boost employment.
it’s one that will invest in our most important priorities like energy and education; health care and a new infrastructure that are necessary to keep us strong and competitive in the 21st century.
today i’d like to talk specifically about the progress we expect to make in each of these areas.
to accelerate the creation of a clean energy economy, we will double our capacity to generate alternative sources of energy like wind, solar, and biofuels over the next three years.
we’ll begin to build a new electricity grid that lay down more than 3,000 miles of transmission lines to convey this new energy from coast to coast.
we’ll save taxpayers $2 billion a year by making 75% of federal buildings more energy efficient, and save the average working family $350 on their energy bills by weatherizing 2.5 million homes.
to lower health care cost, cut medical errors, and improve care, we’ll computerize the nation’s health record in five years, saving billions of dollars in health care costs and countless lives.
and we’ll protect health insurance for more than 8 million americans who are in danger of losing their coverage during this economic downturn.
to ensure our children can compete and succeed in this new economy, we’ll renovate and modernize 10,000 schools, building state-of-the-art classrooms, libraries, and labs to improve learning for over five million students.
we’ll invest more in pell grants to make college affordable for seven million more students, provide a $2,500 college tax credit to four million students, and triple the number of fellowships in science to help spur the next generation of innovation.
finally, we will rebuild and retrofit america to meet the demands of the 21st century.
that means repairing and modernizing thousands of miles of america’s roadways and providing new mass transit options for millions of americans.
it means protecting america by securing 90 major ports and creating a better communications network for local law enforcement and public safety officials in the event of an emergency.
and it means expanding broadband access to millions of americans, so business can compete on a level-playing field, wherever they’re located.
i know that some are skeptical about the size and scale of this recovery plan.
i understand that skepticism, which is why this recovery plan must and will include unprecedented measures that will allow the american people to hold my administration accountable for these results.
we won’t just throw money at our problems -- we’ll invest in what works.
instead of politicians doling out money behind a veil of secrecy, decisions about where we invest will be made public, and informed by independent experts whenever possible.
we’ll launch an unprecedented effort to root out waste, inefficiency, and unnecessary spending in our government, and every american will be able to see how and where we spend taxpayer dollars by going to a new website called recovery.gov.
no one policy or program will solve the challenges we face right now, nor will this crisis recede in a short period of time.
but if we act now and act boldly; if we start rewarding hard work and responsibility once more; if we act as citizens and not partisans and begin again the work of remaking america, then i have faith that we will emerge from this trying time even stronger and more prosperous than we were before.
thanks for listening.
my fellow citizens:
i stand here today humbled by the task before us, grateful for the trust you've bestowed, mindful of the sacrifices borne by our ancestors.
i thank president bush for his service to our nation, as well as the generosity and cooperation he has shown throughout this transition.
forty-four americans have now taken the presidential oath.
the words have been spoken during rising tides of prosperity and the still waters of peace.
yet, every so often the oath is taken amidst gathering clouds and raging storms.
at these moments, america has carried on not simply because of the skill or vision of those in high office, but because we the people have remained faithful to the ideals of our forebearers [sic], and true to our founding documents.
so it has been.
so it must be with this generation of americans.
that we are in the midst of crisis is now well understood.
our nation is at war, against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred.
our economy is badly weakened, a consequence of greed and irresponsibility on the part of some, but also our collective failure to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a new age.
homes have been lost; jobs shed; businesses shuttered.
our health care is too costly; our schools fail too many; and each day brings further evidence that the ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and threaten our planet.
these are the indicators of crisis, subject to data and statistics.
less measurable, but no less profound, is a sapping of confidence across our land -- a nagging fear that america's decline is inevitable, that the next generation must lower its sights.
today i say to you that the challenges we face are real.
they are serious and they are many.
they will not be met easily or in a short span of time.
but know this, america: they will be met.
on this day, we gather because we have chosen hope over fear, unity of purpose over conflict and discord.
on this day, we come to proclaim an end to the petty grievances and false promises, the recriminations and worn out dogmas, that for far too long have strangled our politics.
we remain a young nation, but in the words of scripture, the time has come to "set aside childish things.
"2
the time has come to reaffirm our enduring spirit; to choose our better history; to carry forward that precious gift, that noble idea, passed on from generation to generation: the god-given promise that all are equal, all are free, and all deserve a chance to pursue their full measure of happiness.
in reaffirming the greatness of our nation, we understand that greatness is never a given.
it must be earned.
our journey has never been one of short-cuts or settling for less.
it has not been the path for the faint-hearted -- for those who prefer leisure over work, or seek only the pleasures of riches and fame.
rather, it has been the risk-takers, the doers, the makers of things -- some celebrated but more often men and women obscure in their labor, who have carried us up the long, rugged path towards prosperity and freedom.
for us, they packed up their few worldly possessions and traveled across oceans in search of a new life.
for us, they toiled in sweatshops and settled the west; endured the lash of the whip and plowed the hard earth.
for us, they fought and died, in places like concord and gettysburg; normandy and khe sahn.
time and again these men and women struggled and sacrificed and worked till their hands were raw so that we might live a better life.
they saw america as bigger than the sum of our individual ambitions; greater than all the differences of birth or wealth or faction.
this is the journey we continue today.
we remain the most prosperous, powerful nation on earth.
our workers are no less productive than when this crisis began.
our minds are no less inventive, our goods and services no less needed than they were last week or last month or last year.
our capacity remains undiminished.
but our time of standing pat, of protecting narrow interests and putting off unpleasant decisions - that time has surely passed.
starting today, we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and begin again the work of remaking america.
for everywhere we look, there is work to be done.
the state of our economy calls for action, bold and swift, and we will act -- not only to create new jobs, but to lay a new foundation for growth.
we will build the roads and bridges, the electric grids and digital lines that feed our commerce and bind us together.
we will restore science to its rightful place, and wield technology's wonders to raise health care's quality and lower its cost.
we will harness the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories.
and we will transform our schools and colleges and universities to meet the demands of a new age.
all this we can do.
all this we will do.
now, there are some who question the scale of our ambitions -- who suggest that our system cannot tolerate too many big plans.
their memories are short.
for they have forgotten what this country has already done; what free men and women can achieve when imagination is joined to common purpose, and necessity to courage.
what the cynics fail to understand is that the ground has shifted beneath them -- that the stale political arguments that have consumed us for so long no longer apply.
the question we ask today is not whether our government is too big or too small, but whether it works -- whether it helps families find jobs at a decent wage, care they can afford, a retirement that is dignified.
where the answer is yes, we intend to move forward.
where the answer is no, programs will end.
and those of us who manage the public's dollars will be held to account -- to spend wisely, reform bad habits, and do our business in the light of day -- because only then can we restore the vital trust between a people and their government.
nor is the question before us whether the market is a force for good or ill.
its power to generate wealth and expand freedom is unmatched, but this crisis has reminded us that without a watchful eye, the market can spin out of control.
the nation cannot prosper long when it favors only the prosperous.
the success of our economy has always depended not just on the size of our gross domestic product, but on the reach of our prosperity; on the ability to extend opportunity to every willing heart -- not out of charity, but because it is the surest route to our common good.
as for our common defense, we reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals.
our founding fathers -- our founding fathers, faced with perils that we can scarcely imagine, drafted a charter to assure the rule of law and the rights of man, a charter expanded by the blood of generations.
those ideals still light the world, and we will not give them up for expedience'[s] sake.
and so to all the other peoples and governments who are watching today, from the grandest capitals to the small village where my father was born
: know that america is a friend of each nation and every man, woman, and child who seeks a future of peace and dignity.
and we are ready to lead once more.
recall that earlier generations faced down fascism and communism not just with missiles and tanks, but with the sturdy alliances and enduring convictions.
they understood that our power alone cannot protect us, nor does it entitle us to do as we please.
instead, they knew that our power grows through its prudent use; our security emanates from the justness of our cause, the force of our example, the tempering qualities of humility and restraint.
we are the keepers of this legacy.
guided by these principles once more, we can meet those new threats that demand even greater effort -- even greater cooperation and understanding between nations.
we will begin to responsibly leave iraq to its people, and forge a hard-earned peace in afghanistan.
with old friends and former foes, we will work tirelessly to lessen the nuclear threat, and roll back the specter of a warming planet.
we will not apologize for our way of life, nor will we waver in its defense, and for those who seek to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents, we say to you now that our spirit is stronger and cannot be broken.
you cannot outlast us, and we will defeat you!
for we know that our patchwork heritage is a strength, not a weakness.
we are a nation of christians and muslims, jews and hindus -- and non-believers.
we are shaped by every language and culture, drawn from every end of this earth; and because we have tasted the bitter swill of civil war and segregation, and emerged from that dark chapter stronger and more united, we cannot help but believe that the old hatreds shall someday pass; that the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve; that as the world grows smaller, our common humanity shall reveal itself; and that america must play its role in ushering in a new era of peace.
to the muslim world, we seek a new way forward, based on mutual interest and mutual respect.
to those leaders around the globe who seek to sow conflict, or blame their society's ills on the west -- know that your people will judge you on what you can build, not what you destroy.
to those -- to those who cling to power through corruption and deceit and the silencing of dissent, know that you are on the wrong side of history; but that we will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist.
to the people of poor nations, we pledge to work alongside you to make your farms flourish and let clean waters flow; to nourish starved bodies and feed hungry minds.
and to those nations like ours that enjoy relative plenty, we say we can no longer afford indifference to the suffering outside our borders; nor can we consume the world's resources without regard to effect.
for the world has changed, and we must change with it.
as we consider the road that unfolds before us, we remember with humble gratitude
those brave americans who, at this very hour, patrol far-off deserts and distant mountains.
they have something to tell us, just as the fallen heroes who lie in arlington whisper through the ages.
we honor them not only because they are the guardians of our liberty, but because they embody the spirit of service; a willingness to find meaning in something greater than themselves.
and yet, at this moment -- a moment that will define a generation -- it is precisely this spirit that must inhabit us all.
for as much as government can do and must do, it is ultimately the faith and determination of the american people upon which this nation relies.
it is the kindness to take in a stranger when the levees break, the selflessness of workers who would rather cut their hours than see a friend lose their job which sees us through our darkest hours.
it is the firefighter's courage to storm a stairway filled with smoke, but also a parent's willingness to nurture a child, that finally decides our fate.
our challenges may be new.
the instruments with which we meet them may be new.
but those values upon which our success depends -- honesty and hard work, courage and fair play, tolerance and curiosity, loyalty and patriotism -- these things are old.
these things are true.
they have been the quiet force of progress throughout our history.
what is demanded then is a return to these truths.
what is required of us now is a new era of responsibility -- a recognition, on the part of every american, that we have duties to ourselves, our nation, and the world, duties that we do not grudgingly accept but rather seize gladly, firm in the knowledge that there is nothing so satisfying to the spirit, so defining of our character, than giving our all to a difficult task.
this is the price and the promise of citizenship.
this is the source of our confidence -- the knowledge that god calls on us to shape an uncertain destiny.
this is the meaning of our liberty and our creed -- why men and women and children of every race and every faith can join in celebration across this magnificent mall, and why a man whose father less than sixty years ago might not have been served at a local restaurant can now stand before you to take a most sacred oath.
so let us mark this day with remembrance, of who we are and how far we have traveled.
in the year of america's birth, in the coldest of months, a small band of patriots huddled by dying campfires on the shores of an icy river.
the capitol was abandoned.
the enemy was advancing.
the snow was stained with blood.
at a moment when the outcome of our revolution was most in doubt, the father of our nation ordered these words be read to the people:
let it be told to the future world...
that in the depth of winter, when nothing but hope and virtue could survive...that the city and the country, alarmed at one common danger, came forth to meet [it].
america: in the face of our common dangers, in this winter of our hardship, let us remember these timeless words.
with hope and virtue, let us brave once more the icy currents, and endure what storms may come.
let it be said by our children's children that when we were tested we refused to let this journey end, that we did not turn back nor did we falter; and with eyes fixed on the horizon and god's grace upon us, we carried forth that great gift of freedom and delivered it safely to future generations.
thank you, god bless you, and god bless the united states of america.
hello america!
i want to thank all the speakers and performers today for reminding us, through song and through words, just what it is that we love about america.
i want to thank all of you for braving the cold and the crowds and traveling in some cases thousands of miles to join us here today.
welcome to washington, and welcome to this celebration of american renewal.
in the course of our history, only a handful of generations have been asked to confront challenges as serious as the ones we face right now.
our nation is at war.
our economy is in crisis.
millions of americans are losing their jobs and their homes.
they're worried about how they'll afford college for their kids or pay the stack of bills on their kitchen table.
and most of all, they're anxious and uncertain about the future -- about whether this generation of americans will be able to pass on what's best about this country to our children and their children.
i won't pretend that meeting any one of these challenges will be easy.
it will take more than a month or a year, and it will likely take many.
along the way there will be setbacks and false starts and days that test our resolve as a nation.
but despite all this -- despite the enormity of the task that lies ahead -- i stand here today as hopeful as ever that the united states of america will endure, that it will prevail, that the dream of our founders will live on in our time.
what gives me hope is what i see when i look out across this mall.
for in these monuments are chiseled those unlikely stories that affirm our unyielding faith -- a faith that anything is possible in america.
rising before us stands a memorial to a man who led a small band of farmers and shopkeepers in revolution against the army of an empire, all for the sake of an idea.
on the ground below is a tribute to a generation that withstood war and depression -- men and women like my grandparents who toiled on bomber assembly lines and marched across europe to free the world from tyranny's grasp.
directly in front of us is a pool that still reflects the dream of a king, and the glory of a people who marched and bled so that their children might be judged by their character's content.
and behind me, watching over the union he saved, sits the man who in so many ways made this day possible.
and yet, as i stand here today, what gives me the greatest hope of all is not the stone and marble that surrounds us, but what --
what fills the spaces in between.
it is you -- americans of every race and region and station who came here because you believe in what this country can be and because you want to help us get there.
it's the same thing that gave me hope from the day we began this campaign for the presidency nearly two years ago: a belief that if we could just recognize ourselves in one another and bring everyone together -- democrats, republicans, independents; latino, asian and native american; black and white, gay and straight, disabled and not -- then not only would we restore hope and opportunity in places that yearned for both, but maybe, just maybe, we might perfect our union in the process.
this is what i believed, but you made this belief real.
you proved once more that people who love this country can change it.
and as i prepare to assume the presidency, yours are the voices i will take with me every day when i walk into that oval office -- the voices of men and women who have different stories but hold common hopes; who ask only for what was promised us as americans -- that we might make of our lives what we will and see our children climb higher than we did.
it is this thread that binds us together in common effort; that runs through every memorial on this mall; that connects us to all those who struggled and sacrificed and stood here before.
it is how this nation has overcome the greatest differences and the longest odds -- because there is no obstacle that can stand in the way of millions of voices calling for change.
that is the belief with which we began this campaign, and that is how we will overcome what ails us now.
there is no doubt that our road will be long, that our climb will be steep.
but never forget that the true character of our nation is revealed not during times of comfort and ease, but by the right we do when the moment is hard.
i ask you to help reveal that character once more, and together, we can carry forward as one nation, and one people, the legacy of our forefathers that we celebrate today.
thank you, america.
god bless you.
let me begin by thanking george mason university for their extraordinary hospitality and to thank all the great friends, the governors, the mayors who are in attendance here today.
throughout america's history, there have been some years that simply rolled into the next without much notice or fanfare.
and then there are the years that come along once in a generation, the kind that mark a clean break from a troubled past and set a new course for our nation.
this is one of those years.
we start 2009 in the midst of a crisis unlike any we have seen in our lifetime, a crisis that has only deepened over the last few weeks.
nearly two million jobs have been now lost.
and on friday, we're likely to learn that we lost more jobs last year than at any time since world war ii.
just in the past year, another 2.8 million americans who want and need full-time work have had to settle for part-time jobs.
manufacturing has hit a 28-year low.
many businesses cannot borrow or make payroll.
many families cannot pay their bills or their mortgage.
many workers are watching their life savings disappear.
and many, many americans are both anxious and uncertain of what the future will hold.
now, i don't believe it's too late to change course, but it will be if we don't take dramatic action as soon as possible.
if nothing is done, this recession could linger for years.
the unemployment rate could reach double digits.
our economy could fall 1 trillion dollars short of its full capacity, which translates into more than 12,000 dollars in lost income for a family of four.
we could lose a generation of potential and promise as more young americans are forced to forego dreams of college or the chance to train for the jobs of the future.
and our nation could lose the competitive edge that has served as a foundation for our strength and our standing in the world.
in short, a bad situation could become dramatically worse.
this crisis did not happen solely by some accident of history or normal turn of the business cycle.
and we won't get out of it by simply waiting for a better day to come or relying on the worn-out dogmas of the past.
we arrived at this point due to an era of profound irresponsibility that stretched from corporate board rooms to the halls of power in washington, d.c.
for years, too many wall street executives made imprudent and dangerous decisions, seeking profits with too little regard for risk, too little regulatory scrutiny, and too little accountability.
banks made loans without concern for whether borrowers could repay them, and some borrowers took advantage of cheap credit to take on debt they couldn't afford.
politicians spent taxpayer money without wisdom or discipline and too often focused on scoring political points instead of problems they were sent here to solve.
the result has been a devastating loss of trust and confidence in our economy, our financial markets, and our government.
now, the very fact that this crisis is largely of our own making means that it's not beyond our ability to solve.
our problems are rooted in past mistakes, not our capacity for future greatness.
it will take time -- perhaps many years -- but we can rebuild that lost trust and confidence.
we can restore opportunity and prosperity.
we should never forget that our workers are still more productive than any on earth.
our universities are still the envy of the world.
we are still home to the most brilliant minds, the most creative entrepreneurs, and the most advanced technology and innovation that history has ever known.
and we are still the nation that has overcome great fears and improbable odds.
if we act with the urgency and seriousness that this moment requires, i know that we can do it again.
that is why i have moved quickly to work with my economic team and leaders of both parties on an american recovery and reinvestment plan that will immediately jump-start job creation and long-term growth.
it's a plan that represents not just new policy, but a whole new approach to meeting our most urgent challenges.
for if we hope to end this crisis, we must end the culture of anything goes that helped create it, and this change must begin in washington.
it's time to trade old habits for a new spirit of responsibility.
it's time to finally change the ways of washington so that we can set a new and better course for america.
there is no doubt that the cost of this plan will be considerable.
it will certainly add to the budget deficit in the short term.
but equally certain are the consequences of doing too little or nothing at all, for that will lead to an even greater deficit of jobs, incomes, and confidence in our economy.
it is true that we cannot depend on government alone to create jobs or long-term growth.
but at this particular moment, only government can provide the short-term boost necessary to lift us from a recession this deep and severe.
only government can break the cycle that are [sic] crippling our economy, where a lack of spending leads to lost jobs, which leads to even less spending, where an inability to lend and borrow stops growth and leads to even less credit.
that's why we need to act boldly and act now to reverse these cycles.
that's why we need to put money in the pockets of the american people, create new jobs, and invest in our future.
that's why we need to restart the flow of credit and restore the rules of the road that will ensure a crisis like this never happens again.
now this plan begins with -- this plan must begin today, a plan i am confident will save or create at least three million jobs over the next few years.
it's not just another public works program.
it's a plan that recognizes both the paradox and promise of this moment: the fact that there are millions of americans trying to find work, even as all around the country
there's so much work to be done.
and that's why we'll invest in priorities like energy and education, health care and a new infrastructure that are necessary to keep us strong and competitive in the 21st century.
that's why the overwhelming majority of the jobs created will be in the private sector, while our plan will save the public sector jobs of teachers, police officers, firefighters, and others who provide vital services.
to finally spark the creation of a clean energy economy, we will double the production of alternative energy in the next three years.
we will modernize more than 75 percent of federal buildings and improve the energy efficiency of 2 million american homes, saving consumers and taxpayers billions on our energy bills.
in the process, we will put americans to work in new jobs that pay well and can't be outsourced, jobs building solar panels and wind turbines, constructing fuel-efficient cars and buildings, and developing the new energy technologies that will lead to even more jobs, more savings, and a cleaner, safer planet in the bargain.
to improve the quality of our health care while lowering its cost, we will make the immediate investments necessary to ensure that, within five years, all of america's medical records are computerized.
this will cut waste, eliminate red tape and reduce the need to repeat expensive medical tests.
but it just won't save billions of dollars and thousands of jobs; it will save lives by reducing the deadly but preventable medical errors that pervade our health care system.
to give our children the chance to live out their dreams in a world that's never been more competitive, we will equip tens of thousands of schools, community colleges, and public universities with 21st century classrooms, labs, and libraries.
we'll provide new computers, new technology, and new training for teachers so that students in chicago and boston can compete with children in beijing for the high-tech, high-wage jobs of the future.
to build an economy that can lead this future, we will begin to rebuild america.
yes, we'll put people to work repairing crumbling roads, bridges, and schools by eliminating the backlog of well-planned, worthy, and needed infrastructure projects.
but we'll also do more to retrofit america for a global economy.
that means updating the way we get our electricity by starting to build a new smart grid that will save us money, protect our power sources from blackout or attack, and deliver clean, alternative forms of energy to every corner of our nation.
it means expanding broadband lines across america, so that a small business in a rural town can connect and compete with their counterparts anywhere in the world.
it means investing in the science, research, and technology that will lead to new medical breakthroughs, new discoveries, and entire new industries.
and finally, this recovery and reinvestment plan will provide immediate relief to states, workers, and families who are bearing the brunt of this recession.
to get people spending again, 95% of working families will receive a thousand dollar tax cut -- the first stage of a middle-class tax cut that i promised during the campaign and will include in our next budget.
to help americans who have lost their jobs and can't find new ones, we'll continue the bipartisan extension of unemployment insurance and health care coverage to help them through this crisis.
government at every level will have to tighten its belt, but we'll help struggling states avoid harmful budget cuts, as long as they take responsibility and use the money to maintain essential services like police, fire, education, and health care.
now i understand that some might be skeptical of this plan.
our government has already spent a good deal of money, but we haven't yet seen that translate into more jobs or higher incomes or renewed confidence in our economy.
and that's why the american recovery and reinvestment plan won't just throw money at our problems; we'll invest in what works.
the true test of policies we'll pursue won't be whether they're democratic or republican ideas, whether they're conservative or liberal ideas, but whether they create jobs, grow our economy, and put the american dream within the reach of the american people.
instead of politicians doling out money behind a veil of secrecy, decisions about where we invest will be made transparently, and informed by independent experts wherever possible.
every american will be able to hold washington accountable for these decisions by going online to see how and where their taxpayer dollars are being spent.
and as i announced yesterday, we will launch an unprecedented effort to eliminate unwise and unnecessary spending that has never been more unaffordable for our nation and our children's future than it is right now.
we have to make tough choices and smart investments today so that as the economy recovers, the deficits start coming down.
we cannot have a solid recovery if our people and our businesses don't have confidence that we're getting our fiscal house in order.
and that's why our goal is not to create a slew of new government programs, but a foundation for long-term economic growth.
that also means an economic recovery plan that is free from earmarks and pet projects.
i understand that every member of congress has ideas about how to spend money.
many of these projects are worthy.
they benefit local communities.
but this emergency legislation must not be the vehicle for those aspirations.
this must be a time when leaders in both parties put the urgent needs of our nation above our own narrow interests.
now, this recovery plan alone will not solve all the problems that led us into this crisis.
we must also work with the same sense of urgency to stabilize and repair the financial system we all depend on.
that means using our full arsenal of tools to get credit flowing again to families and businesses, while restoring confidence in our markets.
it means launching a sweeping effort to address the foreclosure crisis so that we can keep responsible families in their homes.
it means preventing the catastrophic failure of financial institutions whose collapse could endanger the entire economy, but only with maximum protections for taxpayers and a clear understanding that government support for any company is an extraordinary action that must come with significant restrictions on the firms that receive support.
and it means reforming a weak and outdated regulatory system so that we can better withstand financial shocks and better protect consumers, investors, and businesses from the reckless greed and risk-taking that must never endanger our prosperity again.
no longer can we allow wall street wrongdoers to slip through regulatory cracks.
no longer can we allow special interests to put their thumbs on the economic scales.
no longer can we allow the unscrupulous lending and borrowing that leads only to destructive cycles of bubble and bust.
it is time to set a new course for this economy, and that change must begin now.
we should have an open and honest discussion about this recovery plan in the days ahead, but i urge congress to move as quickly as possible on behalf of the american people.
for every day we wait or point fingers or drag our feet, more americans will lose their jobs.
more families will lose their savings.
more dreams will be deferred and denied.
and our nation will sink deeper into a crisis that, at some point, we may not be able to reverse.
that is not the country i know.
it is not a future i accept as president of the united states.
a world that depends on the strength of our economy is now watching and waiting for america to lead once more.
and that is what we will do.
it will not come easy or happen overnight, and it is altogether likely that things may get worse before they get better.
but that is all the more reason for congress to act without delay.
i know the scale of this plan is unprecedented, but so is the severity of our situation.
we have already tried the wait-and-see approach to our problems, and it is the same approach that helped lead us to this day of reckoning.
and that is why the time has come to build a 21st century economy in which hard work and responsibility are once again rewarded.
that's why i'm asking congress to work with me and my team day and night, on weekends if necessary, to get the plan passed in the next few weeks.
that's why i'm calling on all americans -- democrats and republicans and independents -- to put -- to put good ideas ahead of the old ideological battles; a sense of common purpose above the same narrow partisanship; and insist that the first question each of us asks isn't, "what's good for me?"
but "what's good for the country my children will inherit?"
more than any program or policy, it is this spirit that will enable us to confront these challenges with the same spirit that has led previous generations to face down war, and depression, and fear itself.
and if we do, if we are able to summon that spirit again, if we are able to look out for one another, and listen to one another, and do our part for our nation and for posterity, then i have no doubt that years from now, we will look back on 2009 as one of those years that marked another new and hopeful beginning for the united states of america.
thank you, god bless you, and may god bless america.
morning, everybody.
last week, vice president-elect biden
and i began the process of announcing our economic team.
today, we are pleased to name another key member of this team: our nominee for secretary of commerce, my great friend, governor bill richardson.
with each passing day, the work our team has begun, developing plans to revive our economy, becomes more urgent.
earlier this week, we learned that the u.s. economy has been in recession since december of 2007 and that our manufacturing output is at a 26 year low -- two stark reminders of the magnitude of the challenges we face.
but while i know rebuilding our economy won’t be easy -- and it won’t be --
happen overnight
-- i also know this: that right now, somewhere in america, a small business is at work with the next big idea; a scientist is on the cusp of the next big breakthrough discovery; an entrepreneur is sketching plans for the startup that will revolutionize an industry.
right now, across america, the finest products in the world are rolling off our assembly lines.
and the proudest, most determined, most productive workers in the world are on the job -- some, already on their second shift of the day; many, putting in longer hours than ever before.
after nearly two years of traveling across this country, meeting with workers, visiting businesses large and small, i am more confident than ever that we have everything we need to renew our economy.
we've got the ingenuity, the technology, the skill, and commitment; we just need to put it to work.
it’s time to not just address the immediate economic threats, but to start laying the groundwork for long-term prosperity to help american businesses grow and thrive at home, and expand our efforts to promote american enterprise around the world.
this work is the core mission of the secretary of commerce.
and with his breadth and depth of experience in public life, governor richardson is uniquely suited for this role as a leading economic diplomat for america.
during his time in state government and congress, and in tour -- two tours of duty in the cabinet, bill has seen from just about every angle what makes our economy work and what keeps it from working better.
as governor of new mexico, bill showed how government can act as a partner to support our businesses, helping to create 80,000 new jobs.
and under his leadership, new mexico saw the lowest unemployment rate in decades.
as a former secretary of energy, bill understands the steps we must take to build a new, clean-energy industry and create the green jobs of the twenty-first century --  jobs that pay well and won’t be outsourced; jobs that will help us end our dependence on foreign oil.
and as a former ambassador to the united nations, bill brings both international stature and a deep understanding of today’s global economy.
he understands that the success of today’s business in detroit or columbus often depends on whether it can sell products in places like santiago or shanghai.
and he knows that america’s reputation in the world is critical not just to our security, but to our prosperity --
(excuse me) -- that when the citizens of the world respect america’s leadership, they are more likely to buy
america’s products.
to this crucial work of restoring america’s international standing, bill will bring a leadership style all his own.
bill has never been content to just learn from briefing books, never satisfied with only the official version of the story.
during his time in congress, he held more than two -- 2,500 town-hall meetings, so he could hear directly from constituents.
he was a regular in the u.n. cafeteria, mixing it up with u.n. employees over lunch.
and during his 2002 campaign for record -- for governor, he actually broke a world record by shaking nearly 14,000 hands in just eight hours.
(i've got to check that statistic.)
all of this reflects a determination to reach out and understand where people are coming from, what they hope for, and what he can do to help.
this approach, i believe, has been the key to bill’s success as a negotiator and will be key to his work on the critical functions of the commerce department -- from administering our census and monitoring our climate to protecting our intellectual property and restoring our economic diplomacy.
in the end, bill richardson is a leader who shares my values, and he must -- and he will be measured his progress the same way i do.
are we creating good jobs instead of losing them?
are incomes growing instead of shrinking?
i know bill will be an unyielding advocate for american business and american jobs at home and around the world.
and i look forward to working with him in the years ahead.
good morning, everybody.
i hope you all had a wonderful thanksgiving.
last week, we announced our economic team, which is working as we speak to craft an economic recovery program to create jobs and grow our struggling economy.
today, vice president-elect biden and i are pleased to announce our national security team.
the national security challenges we face are just as grave -- and just as urgent -- as our economic crisis.
we are fighting two wars.
our old conflicts remain unresolved, and newly assertive powers have put strains on the international system.
the spread of nuclear weapons raises the peril that the world’s deadliest technologies could fall into dangerous hands.
our dependence on foreign oil empowers authoritarian governments and endangers our planet.
america must also be strong at home to be strong abroad.
we need to provide education and opportunity to all our citizens, so every american can compete with anyone, anywhere.
and our economic power must sustain our military strength, our diplomatic leverage, and our global leadership.
the common thread linking these challenges is the fundamental reality that in the 21st century, our destiny is shared with the world's.
from our markets to our security, from our public health to our climate, we must act with the understanding that, now more than ever, we have a stake in what happens across the globe.
and as we learned so painfully on 9/11, terror cannot be contained by borders, nor safety provided by oceans alone.
last week, we were reminded of this threat once again when terrorists took the lives of six american among nearly 200 victims in mumbai.
in the world we seek, there is no place for those who kill innocent civilians to advance hateful extremism.
this weekend, i told prime minister singh of india that americans stand with the people of india in this dark time.
and i am confident that india's great democracy is more resilient than killers who would tear it down.
and so, in this uncertain world, the time has come for a new beginning -- a new dawn of american leadership to overcome the challenges of the 21st century, and to seize the opportunities embedded in those challenges.
we will strengthen our capacity to defeat our enemies and support our friends.
we will renew old alliances and forge new and enduring partnerships.
we will show the world once more that america is relentless in the defense of our people, steady in advancing our interests, and committed to the ideals that shine as a beacon to the world: democracy and justice; opportunity and unyielding hope -- because american values are america’s greatest export to the world.
to succeed, we must pursue a new strategy that skillfully uses, balances, and integrates all elements of american power: our military and diplomacy; our intelligence and law enforcement; our economy and the power of our moral example.
the team that we've assembled here today is uniquely suited to do just that.
in their past service and plans for the future, these men and women represent all of those elements of american power, and the very best of the american example.
they've served in uniform and as diplomats; they have worked as legislators, law enforcement officials, and executives.
they share my pragmatism about the use of power, and my sense of purpose about america's role as a leader in the world.
i have known hillary clinton as a friend, a colleague, a source of counsel, and as a campaign opponent.
she possesses an extraordinary intelligence and a remarkable work ethic.
i am proud that she will be our next secretary of state.
she is an american of tremendous stature who will have my complete confidence, who knows many of the world's leaders, who will command respect in every capitol, and who will clearly have the ability to advance our interests around the world.
hillary’s appointment is a sign to friend and foe of the seriousness of my commitment to renew american diplomacy and restore our alliances.
there is much to do -- from preventing the spread of nuclear weapons to iran and north korea, to seeking a lasting peace between israel and the palestinians, to strengthening international institutions.
i have no doubt that hillary clinton is the right person to lead our state department, and to work with me in tackling this ambitious foreign policy agenda.
at a time when we face unprecedented transition amidst two wars, i've have asked robert gates to continue as secretary of defense, and i'm pleased that he's accepted.
two years ago, he took over the pentagon at a difficult time.
he restored accountability.
he won the confidence of military commanders and the trust of our brave men and women in uniform, as well as their families.
he earned the respect of members of congress on both sides of the aisle for his pragmatism and competence.
he knows that we need a sustainable national security strategy -- and that includes a bipartisan consensus at home.
as i said throughout the campaign, i will be giving secretary gates and our military a new mission as soon as i take office: responsibly ending the war in iraq through a successful transition to iraqi control.
we will also ensure that we have the strategy and resources to succeed against al qaeda and the taliban.
as bob said not too long ago, afghanistan is where the war on terror began, and it is where it must end.
and going forward, we will continue to make the investments necessary to strengthen our military and increase our ground forces to defeat the threats of the 21st century.
eric holder has the talent and commitment to succeed as attorney general from his first day on the job, which is even more important in a transition that demands vigilance.
he has distinguished himself as a prosecutor, a judge, and a senior official, and he is deeply familiar with the law enforcement challenges we face -- from terrorism to counter-intelligence, from white collar crime to public corruption.
eric also has the combination of toughness and independence that we need at the justice department.
let me be clear: the attorney general serves the american people.
and i have every expectation that eric will protect our people, uphold the public trust, and adhere to our constitution.
janet napolitano offers the experience and executive skills we need in the next secretary of homeland security.
she has spent her career protecting people -- as a us attorney, an attorney general, and as the governor of arizona.
she understands the need for a department of homeland security that has the capacity to help prevent terrorist attacks and respond to catastrophe -- be it manmade or natural.
janet assumes this critical role having learned the lessons -- some of them painful -- of the last several years, from 9/11 to katrina.
she insists on competence and accountability.
she knows firsthand the need to have a partner in washington that works well with state and local governments.
she understands as well as anyone the danger of an unsecure border.
and she will be a leader who can reform a sprawling department while safeguarding our homeland.
susan rice will take on the crucial task of serving as permanent representative of the united states to the united nations.
susan has been a close and trusted advisor.
as in previous administrations, the un ambassador will serve as a member of my cabinet and an integral member of my team.
her background as a scholar, on the national security council, and assistant secretary of state will serve our nation well at the united nations.
susan knows that the global challenges we face demand global institutions that work.
she shares my belief that the un is an indispensable and imperfect forum.
she will carry the message that our commitment to multilateral action must be coupled with a commitment to reform.
we need the united nations to be more effective as a venue for collective action -- against terror and proliferation, climate change and genocide, poverty and disease.
finally, i am convinced that general james jones is uniquely suited to be a strong and skilled national security advisor.
generations of joneses have served heroically on the battlefield -- from the beaches of tarawa in world war ii, to foxtrot ridge in vietnam.
jim's silver star is a proud part of that legacy.
he will bring to the job the dual experience of serving in uniform and as a diplomat.
he has commanded a platoon in battle, served as supreme allied commander in a time of war, and worked on behalf of peace in the middle east.
jim is focused on the threats of today and the future.
he understands the connection between energy and national security, and has worked on the frontlines of global instability – from kosovo to northern iraq to afghanistan.
he will advise me and work effectively to integrate our efforts across the government, so that we are effectively using all elements of american power to defeat unconventional threats and promote our values.
i am confident that this team is what we need to make a new beginning for american national security.
this morning, we met to discuss the situation in mumbai and some of the challenges that we face in the months and years ahead.
in the coming weeks, i will be in close contact with these advisors, who will be working with their counterparts in the bush administration to make sure that we are ready to hit the ground running on january 20th.
given the range of threats that we face and the vulnerability that can be a part of every presidential transition, i hope that we can proceed swiftly for those national security officials who demand confirmation.
we move forward with the humility that comes with knowing that there are brave men and women protecting us on our front lines: diplomats and intelligence officers in dangerous corners of the world, troops serving their second, third, or fourth tours; fbi agents in the field, cops on the beat, prosecutors in our courts, and cargo inspectors at our ports.
these selfless americans whose names are unknown to most of us will form the backbone of our effort.
if we serve as well as they are serving, we will protect our country and promote our values.
and as we move forward with respect for america's tradition of a bipartisan national security policy and a commitment to national unity, we have to recall that when it comes to keeping our nation and our people safe, we are not republicans or democrats: we are americans.
there's no monopoly of power or wisdom in either party.
together, as one nation, as one people, we can shape our times instead of being shaped by them.
together, we will meet the challenges of the 21st century not with fear, but with hope.
please be seated.
good morning, everybody.
yesterday we talked about the need to jump-start our economy.
i speak to you today, mindful that we meet at a moment of great challenge for america, as our credit markets are stressed, and our families are struggling.
but as difficult as these times are, i’m confident that we're going to rise to meet this challenge -- if we’re willing to band together and recognize that wall street cannot thrive so long as main street is struggling; if we’re willing to summon a new spirit of ingenuity and determination; and if americans of great intellect, broad experience, and good character are willing to serve in our government at its hour of need.
yesterday, i announced four such americans to help lead the economic team that will advise me as we seek to climb out of this crisis.
today, i'm pleased to announce two other key members of our team: peter orszag as director, and robert nabors as deputy director of the office of management and budget.
before i explain why i selected these outstanding public servants, let me say a few words about the work that i'm asking them to undertake.
as i said yesterday, the economic crisis we face demands that we invest immediately in a series of measures that will help save or create two and a half million jobs and put tax cuts in the pockets of the hard-pressed middle class.
many of those new jobs will come in areas such as energy independence, technology, and health care modernization that will strengthen our economy over the long term.
but if we are going to make the investments we need, we also have to be willing to shed the spending that we don’t need.
in these challenging times, when we're facing both rising deficits and a shrinking economy, budget reform is not an option; it's a necessity.
we can't sustain a system that bleeds billions of taxpayer dollars on programs that have outlived their usefulness, or exist solely because of the power of politicians, lobbyists, or interest groups.
we simply can't afford it.
this isn’t about big government or small government.
it’s about building a smarter government that focuses on what works.
that's why i will ask my new team to think anew and act anew to meet our new challenges.
we are going to go through our federal budget, as i promised during the campaign -- page by page, line by line -- eliminating those programs we don’t need, and insisting that those that we do need operate in a sensible, cost-effective way.
let me just give you one example of what i’m talking about.
there’s a report today from -- that from 2003 to 2006, millionaire farmers received 49 million dollars in crop subsidies even though they were earning more than the 2.5 million cutoff for such subsidies.
now, if this is true -- and this was just a report this morning -- but if it's true, it is a prime example of the kind of waste that i intend to end as president.
we're also going to focus on one of the biggest, long-run challenges that our budget faces -- namely, the rising cost of health care in both the public and private sectors.
this is not just a challenge but also an opportunity to improve the health care that americans rely on and to bring down the costs that taxpayers, businesses, and families have to pay.
now, that's what the office of management and budget will do in my administration.
it will not only help design a budget and manage its implementation, but it's also going to make sure that our government -- your government -- is more efficient and more effective at serving the american people.
and there is no better person to help lead this effort as director of the omb than my friend peter orszag.
peter's been one of our nation’s leading voices on budgetary issues.
it's said that a nation’s budget reflects its values and its priorities.
i believe that's true.
and i know that peter will bring to his work at the omb a set of priorities that i -- and the american people -- share.
throughout his career, he's made significant contributions in our understanding of all the major economic challenges that we're now confronting -- from reducing medical costs to saving social security to fighting global climate change to helping put the dream of a college degree within the reach for more students.
as director of the congressional budget office, he reenergized and reinvigorated the agency, while shifting its focus to confront the health care crisis that is not only a cause of so much suffering for so many families, but a rapidly growing portion of our budget and a drag on our entire economy.
but it's not simply that peter’s
past career makes him qualified for this new appointment; it's also that he has a vision for the future that i share.
he believes, as i do, that even as we take steps to restore discipline to our budget, we also have to take -- take the steps right now that are necessary to solve our immediate crisis.
peter doesn’t need a map to tell him where the bodies are buried in the federal budget.
he knows what works and what doesn’t
, what's worthy of our precious tax dollars and what is not.
just because a program, a special interest tax break, or corporate subsidy is hidden in this year’s budget, does not mean that it will survive the next.
the old ways of washington simply can’t meet the challenges of today and tomorrow.
and no one's more able or more qualified to assist peter in this work than deputy director of the omb that i am nominating, robert nabors.
rob will bring to this post experience in the executive branch, at the omb, where he helped the clinton administration achieve balanced budgets, as well as in the legislative branch, where he led the appropriations committee staff as a driving force for a responsible budget.
together, peter and rob will help steer our budget through congress so that i can sign it into law.
now, let me be clear: these appointments, as well as the appointments that i announced yesterday, are not the sum of my economic team.
these appointments are going to work closely with those that i have not ye[t]
announced -- those including the secretaries of energy and labor, commerce, and health and human services, as well as others in my administration -- to design a recovery path for both wall street and main street, and to put our economy on a path to long-term growth and prosperity.
because at this moment, we must not only restore confidence in our markets.
we also must restore the confidence of middle class families that their government is on their side,
that
it’s working for them and on their behalf to meet their families’ needs.
that's what i intend to do as president of the united states.
the news this past week, including this morning’s news about citigroup, has made it even more clear that we are facing an economic crisis of historic proportions.
our financial markets are under stress.
new home purchases in october were the lowest in half-a-century.
recently, more than half-a-million jobless claims were filed, the highest in 18 years.
and if we do not act swiftly and boldly, most experts now believe that we could lose millions of jobs next year.
while we can’t underestimate the challenges that we face, we also can’t underestimate our capacity to overcome them, to summon that spirit of determination and optimism that has always defined us, and to move forward in a new direction to create new jobs, reform our financial system, and fuel long-term economic growth.
we know this won’t be easy, and it won’t happen overnight.
we’ll need to bring together the best minds in america to guide us, and that is what i’ve sought to do in assembling my economic team.
i’ve sought leaders who could offer both sound judgment and fresh thinking, both a depth of experience and a wealth of bold, new ideas, and most of all who share my fundamental belief that we cannot have a thriving wall street without a thriving main street, that in this country we rise or fall as one nation, as one people.
today, vice president-elect biden and
i are pleased to announce the nomination of four individuals who meet these criteria to lead our economic team: timothy geithner, as secretary of treasury;
lawrence summers, as the director of our national economic council; christina romer, as chair of the council of economic advisers; and melody barnes, as director of domestic -- the domestic policy council.
having served in senior roles at treasury, the imf, and the new york fed, tim geithner offers not just extensive experience shaping economic policy and managing financial markets, he also has an unparalleled understanding of our current economic crisis in all of its depth, complexity, and urgency.
tim will waste no time getting up to speed.
he will start his first day on the job with a unique insight into the failures of today’s markets and a clear vision of the steps we must take to revive them.
the reality is that the economic crisis we face is no longer just an american crisis; it’s a global crisis.
and we will need to reach out to countries around the world to craft a global response.
tim’s extensive international experience makes him uniquely suited to do that work.
growing up partly in africa and having lived and worked throughout asia, having served as undersecretary of the treasury for international affairs, one of the many roles in the international arena, and having studied both chinese and japanese, tim understands the language of today’s international markets in more ways than one.
tim served with distinction under both democrats and republicans and has a long history of working comfortably and as an honest broker on both sides of the aisle.
with stellar performances and outstanding results at every stage of his career, tim has earned the confidence and respect of business, financial, and community leaders, members of congress, and political leaders around the world.
and i know he will do so once again as america’s next treasury secretary, the chief economic spokesman for my administration.
now, like tim, larry summers also brings a singular combination of skill, intellect, and experience to the role he will play in our administration.
as undersecretary, deputy secretary, and then secretary of the treasury, larry helped guide us through several major international financial crises and was a central architect of the policies that led to the longest economic expansion in american history, with record surpluses, rising family incomes, and more than 20 million new jobs.
he also championed a range of measures, from tax credits to enhanced lending programs to consumer financial protections, that greatly benefited middle-income families.
as a thought leader, larry has urged us to confront the problems of income inequality and the middle-class squeeze, consistently arguing that the key to a strong economy is a strong, vibrant, growing middle class.
this idea is at the core of my own economic philosophy and will be the foundation of all of my economic policies.
and as one of the great economic minds of our time, larry has earned a global reputation for being able to cut to the heart of the most complex and novel policy challenges.
with respect to both our current financial crisis and other pressing economic issues of our time, his thinking, writing, and speaking have set the terms of the debate.
i’m glad he will be by my side, playing the critical role of coordinating my administration’s
economic policy in the white house, and i will rely heavily on his advice as we navigate the uncharted waters of this economic crisis.
as one of the most expert people in america on economic crises and how to solve them, my next nominee, christina romer, will bring a critically needed perspective to her work as chair of my council of economic advisors.
christina is both a leading -- both a leading macroeconomist and a leading economic historian, perhaps best known for her work on america’s recovery from the great depression and the robust economic expansion that followed.
since 2003, she’s been co-director of the national bureau of economic research monetary economics program.
she’s also
a member of the bureau’s business cycle dating committee, the body charged with officially determining whether a recession has started and ended, experience which will serve her well as she advises me on our current economic challenges.
christina has done groundbreaking research on many of the topics our administration will confront, from tax policy to fighting recessions.
and her clear-eyed, independent analyses have received praise from both conservative and liberal thinkers alike.
i look forward to her wise counsel in the white house.
finally, we know that rebuilding our economy will require action on a great variety of fronts: from education and health care to energy and social security.
without sound policies in these areas, we can neither enjoy sustained economic growth nor realize our full potential as a people.
so i am extraordinarily pleased that melody barnes, one of the most respected policy experts in america, will serve as my director of domestic -- the domestic policy council, and that she will be working hand in hand with my economic policy team to chart a course to economic recovery.
an integral part of that course will be health care reform, and she will work closely with my secretary of health and human services on that issue.
as executive vice president for policy at the center of -- at the center for american progress, melody directed a network of policy experts dedicated to finding solutions for struggling middle-class families.
she also served as chief counsel to the great senator ted kennedy on the state -- senate judiciary committee, working on issues ranging from crime to immigration to bankruptcy, and fighting tirelessly to protect civil rights, women’s rights, and religious freedom.
melody’s brilliant legal mind and her long experience working to secure the liberties on which this nation was founded, as well as to secure the opportunities for those who’ve been left behind, make her a perfect fit for dpc director.
i'm grateful that tim, larry, christina, and melody have accepted my nomination, and i am looking forward to working closely with them in the months ahead.
that work starts today, because the truth is, we do not have a minute to waste.
right now, our economy is trapped in a vicious cycle: the turmoil on wall street means a new round of belt-tightening for families and businesses on main street, and as folks produce less and consume less, that just deepens the problems in our financial markets.
these extraordinary stresses on our financial system require extraordinary policy responses.
and my administration will honor the public commitments made by the current administration to address this crisis.
further, beyond any immediate actions we may take, we need a recovery plan for both wall street and main street, a plan that stabilizes our financial system and gets credit flowing again, while at the same time addressing our growing foreclosure crisis, helping our struggling auto industry, and creating and saving 2.5 million jobs, jobs rebuilding our infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, modernizing our schools, and creating the clean energy infrastructure of the 21st century.
because at this moment, we need to restore both confidence in the markets and restore confidence of middle-class families, who find themselves working harder, earning less, and falling further and further behind.
i’ve asked my economic team to develop recommendations for this plan and to consult with congress, the current administration, and the federal reserve on immediate economic developments over the next two months.
i’ve requested that they brief me on these matters on a daily basis.
and in the coming weeks, i will provide the american people and the incoming congress with an overview of their initial recommendations.
it is my hope that the new congress will begin work on an aggressive economic recovery plan when they convene in early january so that our administration can hit the ground running.
with our economy in distress, we cannot hesitate and we cannot delay.
our families can’t afford to keep on waiting and hoping for a solution.
they can’t afford to watch another month of unpaid bills pile up, another semester of tuition slip out of reach, another month where, instead of saving for retirement, they’re dipping into their savings just to get by.
and i want to repeat: this will not be easy.
there are no shortcuts or quick fixes to this crisis, which has been many years in the making, and the economy is likely to get worse before it gets better.
full recovery will not happen immediately.
and to make the investments we need, we’ll have to scour our federal budget, line by line, and make meaningful cuts and sacrifices, as well, something i’ll be discussing further tomorrow.
despite all of this, i am hopeful about the future.
i have full confidence in the wisdom and ingenuity of my economic team and in the hard work, courage, and sacrifice of the american people.
and most of all, i believe deeply in the resilience and the spirit of this nation.
i know we can work our way out of this crisis because we’ve done it before.
and i know we will succeed once again if we put aside partisanship and politics and work together.
that’s exactly what i intend to do as president of the united states.
let me begin by thanking the bipartisan group of u.s. governors who convened this meeting.
few challenges facing america -- and the world -- are more urgent than combating climate change.
the science is beyond dispute and the facts are clear.
sea levels are rising.
coastlines are shrinking.
we’ve seen record drought, spreading famine, and storms that are growing stronger with each passing hurricane season.
climate change and our dependence on foreign oil, if left unaddressed, will continue to weaken our economy and threaten our national security.
i know many of you are working to confront this challenge.
in particular, i want to commend governor sebelius, governor doyle, governor crist, governor blagojevich and your host, governor schwarzenegger.
all of you have shown true leadership in the fight to combat global warming.
and we’ve also seen a number of businesses doing their part by investing in clean energy technologies.
but too often, washington has failed to show the same kind of leadership.
that will change when i take office.
my presidency will mark a new chapter in america’s leadership on climate change that will strengthen our security and create millions of new jobs in the process.
that will start with a federal cap and trade system.
we'll establish strong annual targets that set us on a course to reduce emissions to their 1990 levels by 2020 and reduce them an additional 80% by 2050.
further, we'll invest 15 billion dollars each year to catalyze private sector efforts to build a clean energy future.
we'll invest in solar power, wind power, and next-generation biofuels.
we'll tap nuclear power, while making sure it’s safe; and we'll develop clean coal technologies.
this investment will not only help us reduce our dependence on foreign oil, making the united states more secure; and it will not only help us bring about a clean energy future, saving the planet.
it will also help us transform our industries and steer our country out of this economic crisis by generating five million new green jobs that pay well and can’t be outsourced.
the truth is, the united states can't meet this challenge alone.
solving this problem will require all of us working together.
i understand that your meeting is being attended by government officials from over a dozen countries, including the uk, canada, mexico, brazil and chile, poland and australia, india and indonesia.
and i look forward to working with all nations to meet this challenge in the coming years.
let me also say a special word to the delegates from around the world who will gather at poland next month.
your work is vital to the planet.
while i won’t be president at the time of your meeting and while the united states has only one president at a time, i’ve asked members of congress who are attending the conference as observers to report back to me on what they learn there.
and once i take office, you can be sure that the united states will once again engage vigorously in these negotiations, and help lead the world toward a new era of global cooperation on climate change.
now is the time to confront this challenge once and for all.
delay is no longer an option.
denial is no longer an acceptable response.
the stakes are too high; the consequences too serious.
stopping climate change won’t be easy and it won’t happen overnight.
but i promise you this: when i am president, any governor who’s willing to promote clean energy will have a partner in the white house.
any company that’s willing to invest in clean energy will have an ally in washington.
and any nation that’s willing to join the cause of combating climate change will have an ally in the united states of america.
thank you.
this morning we woke up to more sobering news about the state of our economy.
the 240,000 jobs lost in october marks the 10th consecutive month that our economy has shed jobs.
in total, we've lost nearly 1.2 million jobs this year, and more than 10 million americans are now unemployed.
tens of millions of families are struggling to figure out how to pay the bills and stay in their homes.
their stories are an urgent reminder that we are facing the greatest economic challenge of our lifetime, and we're going to have to act swiftly to resolve it.
now, the united states has only one government and one president at a time, and until january 20th of next year, that government is the current administration.
i've spoken to president bush.
i appreciate his commitment to ensuring that his economic policy team keeps us fully informed as developments unfold.
and i'm also thankful for his invitation to the white house.
immediately after i become president, i'm going to confront this economic crisis head-on by taking all necessary steps to ease the credit crisis, help hardworking families, and restore growth and prosperity.
this morning i met with members of my transition economic advisory board, who are standing behind me, alongside my vice president-elect, joe biden.
they will help to guide the work of my transition team, working with rahm emanuel, my chief of staff, in developing a strong set of policies to respond to this crisis.
we discussed in the earlier meeting several of the most immediate challenges facing our economy and key priorities on which to focus on in the days and weeks ahead.
first of all, we need a rescue plan for the middle class that invests in immediate efforts to create jobs and provide relief to families that are watching their paychecks shrink and their life savings disappear.
a particularly urgent priority is a further extension of -- of unemployment insurance benefits for workers who cannot find work in the increasingly weak economy.
a fiscal stimulus plan that will jump-start economic growth is long overdue.
i've talked about it throughout this -- the last few months of the campaign.
we should get it done.
second, we have to address the spreading impact of the financial crisis on the other sectors of our economy -- small businesses that are struggling to meet their payrolls and finance their holiday inventories, and state and municipal governments facing devastating budget cuts and tax increases.
we must also remember that the financial crisis is increasingly global and requires a global response.
the news coming out of the auto industry this week reminds us of the hardship it faces -- hardship that goes far beyond individual auto companies to the countless suppliers, small businesses, and communities throughout our nation who depend on a vibrant american auto industry.
the auto industry is the backbone of american manufacturing and a critical part of our attempt to reduce our dependence on foreign oil.
i would like to see the administration do everything it can to accelerate the retooling assistance that congress has already enacted.
in addition, i have made it a high priority for my transition team to work on additional policy options to help the auto industry adjust, weather the financial crisis, and succeed in producing fuel-efficient cars here in the united states of america.
and i was glad to be joined today by governor jennifer granholm, who obviously has great knowledge and great interest on this issue.
i've asked my team to explore what we can do under current law and whether additional legislation will be needed for this purpose.
third, we will review the implementation of this administration's financial program to ensure that the government's efforts are achieving their central goal of stabilizing financial markets while protecting taxpayers, helping homeowners, and not unduly rewarding the management of financial firms that are receiving government assistance.
it is absolutely critical that the treasury work closely with the fdic, hud, and other government agencies to use the substantial authority that they already have to help families avoid foreclosure and stay in their homes.
finally, as we monitor and address these immediate economic challenges, we will be moving forward in laying out a set of policies that will grow our middle class and strengthen our economy in the long term.
we cannot afford to wait on moving forward on the key priorities that i identified during the campaign, including clean energy, health care, education, and tax relief for middle-class families.
my transition team will be working on each of these priorities in the weeks ahead, and i intend to reconvene this advisory board to discuss the best ideas for responding to these immediate problems.
let me close by saying this: i do not underestimate the enormity of the task that lies ahead.
we have taken some major action to date, and we will need further action during this transition and subsequent months.
some of the choices that we make are going to be difficult.
and i have said before
and i will repeat again
: it is not going to be quick
and it is not going to be easy for us to dig ourselves out of the hole that we are in, but america is a strong and resilient country.
and i know we will succeed if we put aside partisanship and politics and work together as one nation.
that's what i intend to do.
hello, chicago.
if there is anyone out there who still doubts that america is a place where all things are possible; who still wonders if the dream of our founders is alive in our time; who still questions the power of our democracy, tonight is your answer.
it's the answer told by lines that stretched around schools and churches in numbers this nation has never seen; by people who waited three hours and four hours, many for the very first time in their lives, because they believed that this time must be different; that their voices could be that difference.
it's the answer spoken by young and old, rich and poor, democrat and republican, black, white, hispanic, asian, native american, gay, straight, disabled and not disabled -- americans who sent a message to the world that we have never been just a collection of individuals or a collection of red states and blue states:
we are, and always will be, the united states of america!
it's the answer that -- that led those who have been told for so long by so many to be cynical, and fearful, and doubtful about what we can achieve to put their hands on the arc of history and bend it once more toward the hope of a better day.
it's been a long time coming, but
tonight, because of what we did on this day, in this election, at this defining moment, change has come to america.
a little bit earlier this evening, i received an extraordinarily gracious call from senator mccain.
senator mccain fought long and hard in this campaign, and he's fought even longer and harder for the country that he loves.
he has endured sacrifices for america that most of us cannot begin to imagine.
we are better off for the service rendered by this brave and selfless leader.
i congratulate him; i congratulate governor palin for all that they've achieved, and i look forward to working with them to renew this nation's promise in the months ahead.
i want to thank my partner in this journey, a man who campaigned from his heart and spoke for the men and women he grew up with on the streets of scranton and rode with on the train home to delaware, the vice president-elect of the united states, joe biden.
and i would not be standing here tonight without the unyielding support of my best friend for the last 16 years, the rock of our family, the love of my life, the nation's next first lady: michelle obama.
sasha and malia, i love you both more than you can imagine, and you have earned the new puppy that's coming with us to the white house.
and while she's no longer with us, i know my grandmother's watching, along with the family that made me who i am.
i miss them tonight, and i know that my debt to them is beyond measure.
to my sister maya, my sister alma, all my other brothers and sisters -- thank you so much for the support that you've given me.
i am grateful to them.
and to my campaign manager, david plouffe -- the unsung hero of this campaign, who built the best -- the best political campaign, i think, in the history of the united states of america.
to my chief strategist david axelrod -- who's been a partner with me every step of the way.
to the best campaign team ever assembled in the history of politics -- you made this happen, and i am forever grateful for what you've sacrificed to get it done.
but above all, i will never forget who this victory truly belongs to.
it belongs to you.
it belongs to you.
i was never the likeliest candidate for this office.
we didn't start with much money or many endorsements.
our campaign was not hatched in the halls of washington.
it began in the backyards of des moines and the living rooms of concord and the front porches of charleston.
it was built by working men and women who dug into what little savings they had to give 5 dollars and 10 dollars and 20 dollars to the cause.
it grew strength from the young people who rejected the myth of their generation's apathy, who left their homes and their families for jobs that offered little pay and less sleep.
it drew strength from the not-so-young people who braved the bitter cold and scorching heat to knock on doors of perfect strangers, and from the millions of americans who volunteered and organized and proved that more than two centuries later a government of the people, by the people, and for the people has not perished from the earth.
this is your victory.
and i know you didn't do this just to win an election.
and i know you didn't do it for me.
you did it because you understand the enormity of the task that lies ahead.
for even as we celebrate tonight, we know the challenges that tomorrow will bring are the greatest of our lifetime:
two wars, a planet in peril, the worst financial crisis in a century.
even as we stand here tonight, we know there are brave americans waking up in the deserts of iraq and the mountains of afghanistan to risk their lives for us.
there are mothers and fathers who will lie awake after the children fall asleep and wonder how they'll make the mortgage or pay their doctors' bills or save enough for their child's college education.
there's new energy to harness, new jobs to be created, new schools to build, and threats to meet, alliances to repair.
the road ahead will be long.
our climb will be steep.
we may not get there in one year or even in one term.
but, america, i have never been more hopeful than i am tonight that we will get there.
i promise you, we as a people will get there.
there will be setbacks and false starts.
there are many who won't agree with every decision or policy i make as president.
and we know the government can't solve every problem.
but i will always be honest with you about the challenges we face.
i will listen to you, especially when we disagree.
and, above all, i will ask you to join in the work of remaking this nation, the only way it's been done in america for 221 years -- block by block, brick by brick, calloused hand by calloused hand.
what began 21 months ago in the depths of winter cannot end on this autumn night.
this victory alone is not the change we seek.
it is only the chance for us to make that change.
and that cannot happen if we go back to the way things were.
it can't happen without you, without a new spirit of service, a new spirit of sacrifice.
so let us summon a new spirit of patriotism, of responsibility, where each of us resolves to pitch in and work harder and look after not only ourselves but each other.
let us remember that, if this financial crisis taught us anything, it's that we cannot have a thriving wall street while main street suffers.
in this country, we rise or fall as one nation, as one people.
let's resist the temptation to fall back on the same partisanship and pettiness and immaturity that has poisoned our politics for so long.
let's remember that it was a man from this state who first carried the banner of the republican party to the white house, a party founded on the values of self-reliance and individual liberty and national unity.
those are values that we all share.
and while the democratic party has won a great victory tonight, we do so with a measure of humility and determination to heal the divides that have held back our progress.
as lincoln said to a nation far more divided than ours: "we are not enemies but friends...."
"though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection.
"¹
and to those americans who -- whose support i have yet to earn, i may not have won your vote tonight, but i hear your voices.
i need your help.
and i will be your president, too.
and to all those watching tonight from beyond our shores, from parliaments and palaces, to those who are huddled around radios in the forgotten corners of the world, our stories are singular, but our destiny is shared, and a new dawn of american leadership is at hand.
to those -- to those who would tear the world down: we will defeat you.
to those who seek peace and security: we support you.
and to all those who have wondered if america's beacon still burns as bright: tonight we've proved once more that the true strength of our nation comes not from the might of our arms or the scale of our wealth, but from the enduring power of our ideals: democracy, liberty, opportunity, and unyielding hope.
that's the true genius of america: that america can change.
our union can be perfected.
what we've already achieved gives us hope for what we can and must achieve tomorrow.
this election had many firsts and many stories that will be told for generations.
but one that's on my mind
tonight's about a woman who cast her ballot in atlanta.
she's a lot like the millions of others who stood in line to make their voice heard in this election except for one thing: ann nixon cooper is 106 years old.
she was born just a generation past slavery; a time when there were no cars on the road or planes in the sky; when someone like her couldn't vote for two reasons: because she was a woman and because of the color of her skin.
and tonight, i think about all that she's seen throughout her century in america -- the heartache and the hope; the struggle and the progress; the times we were told that we can't, and the people who pressed on with that american creed: yes we can.
at a time when women's voices were silenced and their hopes dismissed, she lived to see them stand up and speak out and reach for the ballot: yes we can.
when there was despair in the dust bowl and depression across the land, she saw a nation conquer fear itself with a new deal, new jobs, a new sense of common purpose: yes we can.
when the bombs fell on our harbor and tyranny threatened the world, she was there to witness a generation rise to greatness and
a democracy was saved: yes we can.
she was there for the buses in montgomery, the hoses in birmingham, a bridge in selma, and a preacher from atlanta who told a people that "we shall overcome":
yes we can.
a man touched down on the moon, a wall came down in berlin, a world was connected by our own science and imagination.
and this year, in this election, she touched her finger to a screen, and cast her vote, because after 106 years in america, through the best of times and the darkest of hours, she knows how america can change: yes we can.
america, we have come so far.
we have seen so much.
but there is so much more to do.
so tonight, let us ask ourselves --
if our children should live to see the next century; if my daughters should be so lucky to live as long as ann nixon cooper, what change will they see?
what progress will we have made?
this is our chance to answer that call.
this is our moment.
this is our time, to put our people back to work and open doors of opportunity for our kids; to restore prosperity and promote the cause of peace; to reclaim the american dream and reaffirm that fundamental truth, that, out of many, we are one;² that while we breathe, we hope.
and where we are met with cynicism and doubt and those who tell us that we can't, we will respond with that timeless creed that sums up the spirit of a people:
yes, we can.
thank you.
god bless you.
and may god bless the united states of america.
thank you very much, madam president.
and thank you to the distinguished senator from connecticut not only for yielding time, but also for the extraordinarily hard work that he's put in over the last several days and, in fact, over a -- a week.
and i want to thank his counterparts on the other side, including senator gregg, for their hard work.
now, the fact that we're even here voting on a plan to rescue our economy from the greed and irresponsibility of wall street and some in washington is an outrage.
it's an outrage to every american who works hard, pays their taxes, is doing their best every day to make a better life for themselves and their families.
and understandably, people are frustrated and they're angry that wall street's mistakes have put their tax dollars at risk.
and they should be.
i'm frustrated and angry, too.
but while there's plenty of blame to go around -- and many in washington and wall street who deserve it, all of us -- all of us have a responsibility to solve this crisis, because it affects the financial well-being of every single american.
there will be time to punish those who set this fire, but now is not the time to argue about how it got set, or did the neighbor sleep in his bed, or leave the stove on.
right now we want to put out that fire; and now's the time for us to come together and do that.
when the house of representatives failed to act on monday, we saw the single largest decline in the stock market in two decades.
over one trillion dollars of wealth was lost by the time the markets closed.
and it wasn't just the wealth of a few ceos or wall street executives.
the 401(k)s and retirement accounts of millions became smaller.
the state pension funds of teachers and government employees lost billions upon billions of dollars.
hard-working americans who invested their nest egg to watch it grow saw it diminish and in some cases disappear.
and while that decline was devastating, the consequences of the credit crisis that caused it will be even worse if we do not act now.
we're in a very dangerous situation, where financial institutions across this country are afraid to lend money.
and if all that meant was the failure of a few banks in new york, that would be one thing.
but that's not what it means.
what it means is, if we don't act, it will be harder for americans to get a mortgage for their home or loans they need to buy a car or send their children to college.
what it means is that businesses won't be able to get the loans they need to open a new factory or make payroll for their workers.
and if they can't make payroll on friday, then workers are laid off on monday.
and if workers are laid off on monday, then they can't pay their bills or pay back their loans to somebody else.
and it will go on and on and on, rippling through the entire economy.
and potentially we could see thousands of businesses close, millions of jobs could be lost, and a long and painful recession could follow.
in other words, this is not just a wall street crisis; it's an american crisis.
and it's the american economy that needs this rescue plan.
i understand completely why people would be skeptical when this president asks for a blank check to solve this problem.
i was, too, as was senator dodd and a whole bunch of us here.
and that's why, over a week ago, i demanded that this plan include some specific proposals to protect taxpayers, protections that the administration eventually agreed to, and, thanks to the hard work of senator dodd and republican counterparts like senator gregg,
we here in the senate have agreed to, and now hopefully the house will agree to, as well.
let me just go over those principles:
number one
, i said we needed an independent board to provide oversight and accountability for how and where this money is spent at every step of the way.
number two
, i said that we cannot help banks on wall street without helping the millions of innocent homeowners who are struggling to stay in their homes.
they deserve a plan, too.
number three
, i said that i would not allow this plan to become a welfare program for wall street executives, whose greed and irresponsibility got us into this mess.
and, finally, i said that, if american taxpayers are financing this solution, then they have to be treated like investors.
they should get every penny of their tax dollars back once the economy recovers.
now, this last part is important, because it's been the most misunderstood and poorly communicated part of this plan.
this is not a plan to just hand over 700 billion dollars of taxpayer money to a few banks.
if this is managed correctly -- and that's an important "if" -- we will hopefully get most or all of our money back and possibly even turn a profit on the government's intervention, every penny of which will go directly back to the american people.
and if we fall short, we will levy a fee on financial institutions so that they can repay for the losses that they caused.
now, let me -- let's acknowledge, even with all these taxpayer protections, this plan is not perfect.
democrats and republicans in congress have legitimate concerns about it.
some of my closest colleagues, people
i have the greatest respect for, still have problems with it and may choose to vote against this bill, and i think that we can respectfully disagree.
i understand their frustrations.
i also know that many -- many americans share their concerns.
but it's clear that, from my perspective, this is what we need to do right now to prevent the possibility of a crisis turning into a catastrophe.
it is conceivable -- it's possible that if we did nothing everything would turn out
okay.
it's -- there
-- there's a possibility that that's true.
and there's no doubt that there may be other plans out there that, had we had two or three or six months to develop, might be even more refined and might serve our purposes better.
but we don't have that kind of time.
and we can't afford to take a risk that the economy of the united states of america and, as a consequence, the worldwide economy could be plunged into a very, very deep hole.
so to democrats and republicans who've opposed this plan, i say: step up to the plate.
let's do what's right for the country at this time, because the time to act is now.
i know many americans are wondering what happens next.
and passing this bill can't be the end of our work to strengthen our economy; it must be the beginning.
because one thing i
-- i think all of us who may end up supporting this bill understand is that, even if we get this in place, we could still have enormous problems and probably will have big problems in the economy over the next several months and potentially longer;
because the fact is, is that we have seen some mismanagement of the fundamentals of the economy for a very long time, and we are not going to dig ourselves out of that hole immediately.
so this is not the end.
this is the beginning.
as soon as we pass this rescue plan, we need to move aggressively with the same sense of urgency to rescue families on main street who are struggling to pay their bills and keep their jobs.
they've been in crisis a lot longer than wall street has.
i've said it before
and i say it again:
we need to pass an economic stimulus package that will help ordinary americans cope with rising food and gas prices, that can save one million jobs rebuilding our schools, and roads, and our infrastructure, and help states and cities avoid budget cuts and tax increase[s], a -- a plan that would extend expiring unemployment benefits for those americans who've lost their jobs and cannot find new ones.
that's the right thing to do at a time when consumer confidence is down
and we are in great danger of slipping into a big recession.
we also must do more in this rescue package in order to help homeowners stay in their homes.
i will continue to advocate bankruptcy reforms.
i know my colleague from illinois, dick durbin, has been a strong champion of this, as have many.
it is the right thing to do to change our bankruptcy laws so that people have a better chance of staying in their homes
and we're not seeing communities devastated all across the country.
and we should encourage treasury to study the option of buying individual mortgages, like we did successfully in the 1930s.
and finally, while we all hope that this rescue package succeeds, we should be prepared to take more vigorous actions in the months ahead to rebuild capital, if it's necessary.
now, just as families are planning for their future in tough times, washington's going to have to do the same.
runaway spending and record deficits are not how families run their budgets.
it can't be how washington handles people's tax dollars.
so we're going to have to return to the fiscal responsibility we had in the 1990s.
and the next white house and the next congress is going to have to work together to make sure that we go through our budget, we get rid of programs that don't work, that we make the ones that do work better and cost less.
with less money flowing into the treasury, some useful programs or policies might need to be delayed.
and some might be -- need to be stretched out over a longer period of time.
but there are certain investments in our future that we cannot delay, precisely because our economy is in turmoil.
mr. president, i've exceeded the time a little bit.
i would like unanimous consent for a couple more minutes.
[cross talk from the floor]
senate president: is there objection?
seeing no objection --
senator obama: thank you.
there are certain investments in our future that we can't delay precisely be -- because the economy's in turmoil.
we can't wait to help americans keep up with rising costs and shrinking paychecks, and we're going to do that by making sure that we are giving our workers a middle-class tax cut.
we can't wait to relieve the burden of crushing health care costs.
we can't wait to create millions of new jobs by rebuilding our roads and our bridges, and investing in broadband lines in rural communities, and fixing our electricity grid so we can get renewable energy to population centers that need them.
and we need to develop an energy policy that prevents us from sending 700 billion dollars a year to tyrants and dictators for their oil.
we can't wait to educate the next generation of americans with the skills and knowledge they need to compete with any workers anywhere in the world.
these are the priorities we cannot delay.
now, let me just close by saying this: i do not think this is going to be easy.
it's not going to come without costs.
we are all going to need to sacrifice.
we're all going to need to pull our weight, because now, more than ever, we are all in this together.
that's part of what this crisis has taught us -- that in the end of the day, there's no real separation between wall street and main street.
there's only the road we're traveling on as americans.
and we will rise or fall on that journey as one nation and as one people.
i know that many americans are feeling anxiety right now about their jobs, about their homes, about their life savings.
but i also know this, that we can steer ourselves out of this crisis.
we are -- always have.
during the great financial crisis of the last century, in his first fireside chat, fdr told his fellow americans that,

there is an element in the re-adjustment of our financial system more important than currency, more important than gold, and that is the confidence of the people themselves.
confidence and courage are the essentials of success in carrying out our plan.
let us unite in banishing fear.
together we cannot fail.
we cannot fail, not now, not tomorrow, not next year.
this is a nation that's faced down war and depression, great challenges and great threats.
and at each and every moment, we have risen to meet up these challenges, not as democrats, not as republicans, but as americans, with resolve and with confidence, with that fundamental belief that, here in america, our destiny is not written for us, it's written by us.
and that's who we are.
and that's the country
i know we can be right now.
i want to thank again the extraordinary leadership of chairman dodd and banking --  the banking committee, as well as chairman baucus and majority leader reid.
they have worked tirelessly.
i want to thank the leadership in the house of representatives.
i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation, understanding that this will not solve all our problems.
it is a necessary but not sufficient step to make sure that this economy once again works on behalf of all americans in their pursuit of the american dream.
thank you, mr. president.
i yield the floor.
thank you so much.
thank you very much.
thank you everybody.
to -- to chairman dean, and my great friend, dick durbin, and to all my fellow citizens of this great nation, with profound gratitude and great humility --
i accept your nomination for the presidency of the united states.
let me -- let me express -- let me express my thanks to the historic slate of candidates who accompanied on this journey, and
especially the one who traveled the farthest, a champion for working americans and an inspiration to my daughters and yours: hillary rodham clinton.
to president clinton -- to president bill clinton, who made last night the case for change as only he can make it, to ted kennedy, who embodies the spirit of service, and to the next vice president of the united states, joe biden, i thank you.
i am grateful to finish this journey with one of the finest statesmen of our time, a man at ease with everyone from world leaders to the conductors on the amtrak train he still takes home every night, to the love of my life -- the next first lady, michelle obama; and to mahlia and sasha, i love you so much
and i am so proud of you.
four years ago, i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who weren't well-off or well-known, but shared a belief that in america, their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to.
it is that promise that's always set this country apart --
that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family, to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well.
it's why i stand here tonight.
because for two hundred and thirty two years, at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy, ordinary men and women, students and soldiers, farmers and teachers, nurses and janitors -- found the courage to keep it alive.
we meet at one of those defining moments -- a moment when our nation is at war, our economy is in turmoil, and the american promise has been threatened once more.
tonight, more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less.
more of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet.
more of you have cars you can't afford to drive, credit cards bills [sic]
you can't afford to pay and tuition
that's beyond your reach
these challenges are not all of government's making.
but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w. bush.
america, we are better than these last eight years.
we are a better country than this.
this country's more decent than one woman in ohio on the brink of retirement finds herself one disaster after a lifetime of hard work.
we're a better country than one where a man in indiana has to pack up the equipment that's
he's worked on for twenty years and watch as its shipped off to china, and then chokes up as he explains how he felt like a failure when he went home to tell his family the news.
we are more compassionate than a government that lets veterans sleep on our streets, and families slide into poverty; that sits --
that sits on its hands while a major american city drowns before our eyes.
tonight -- tonight i say to the people of america, to democrats and republicans and independents across this great land: enough!
this moment -- this moment -- this election is our chance to keep, in the 21st century, the american promise alive.
because next week, in minnesota, the same party that brought you two terms of george bush and dick cheney will ask this country for a third.
and we are here -- we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight.
on november 4th -- on november 4th, we must stand up and say: "eight is enough."
now -- now let me -- let -- let there be no doubt: the republican nominee, john mccain, has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction, and for that we owe him our gratitude and our respect.
and next week, we'll also hear about those occasions when he's broken with his party as evidence that he can deliver the change that we need.
but the record's clear
: john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time.
senator mccain likes to talk about judgment, but really, what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time?
i -- i don't know about you, but i'm not ready to take a ten percent chance on change.
the truth is on issue after issue that would make a difference in your lives -- on health care and education and the economy, senator mccain has been anything but independent.
he says that our economy has made great progress under this president.
he said that the fundamentals of the economy are strong.
and when one of his chief advisors -- the man who wrote his economic plan -- was talking about the anxieties that americans are feeling, he said that we were just suffering from a mental recession, and that we've become -- and i quote --
"a nation of whiners.
"
a nation of whiners.
tell that to the proud autoworkers at a michigan plant who, after they found out it was closing, kept showing up everyday and working as hard as ever because they knew there were people who counted on the brakes that they made.
tell that to the military families who shoulder their burden silently as they watch their loved ones leave for there third or fourth or fifth tour of duty.
these are not whiners.
they work hard and they give back
and they keep going without complaint.
these are the americans i know.
now, i don't believe that senator mccain doesn't care what's going on in the lives of americans.
i just think he doesn't know.
why else would he define "middle-class" as someone making under five million dollars a year?
how else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than one hundred million americans?
how else could he offer a health care plan that would actually tax people's benefits, or an education plan that would do nothing to help families pay for college, or a plan that would privatize social security and gamble your retirement?
it's not because john mccain doesn't care; it's because john mccain doesn't get it.
for over two decades -- for over two decades, he's subscribed to that old, discredited republican philosophy: give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else.
in washington, they call this the "ownership society," but what it really means is that you're on your own.
out of work?
tough luck, you're on your own.
no health care?
the market will fix it.
you're on your own.
born into poverty?
pull yourself up by your own bootstraps, even if you don't have boots.
you are on your own.
well, it's time for them to own their failure.
it's time for us to change america.
and that's why i'm running for president of the united states.
you see -- you see, we democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country.
we measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage, whether you can put a little extra money away at the end of each month
so you can someday watch your child receive her college diploma.
we measure progress in the 23 million new jobs that were created when bill clinton was president, when the average american family saw its income go up 7,500 dollars instead of go down 2,000 dollars, like it has under george bush.
we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500, but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business, or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off and look after a sick kid without losing her job, an economy that honors the dignity of work.
the fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great, a promise that is the only reason i am standing here tonight.
because, in the faces of those young veterans who come back from iraq and afghanistan, i see my grandfather, who signed up after pearl harbor, marched in patton's army, and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the g.i. bill.
in the face of that young student, who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift, i think about my mom, who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree, who once turned to food stamps, but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships.
when i -- when i listen to another worker tell me that his factory has shut down, i remember all those men and women on the south side of chicago who i stood by and fought for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed.
and when i hear a woman talk about the difficulties of starting her own business or making her way in the world, i think about my grandmother, who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle management, despite years of being passed over for promotions because she was a woman.
she's the one who taught me about hard work.
she's the one who put off buying a new car or a new dress for herself so that i could have a better life.
she poured everything she had into me.
and although she can no longer travel, i know that she's watching tonight and that tonight is her night, as well.
now -- now , i don't know what kind of lives
john mccain thinks that celebrities lead, but this has been mine.
these are my heroes; theirs are the stories that shaped my life.
and it is on behalf of them that i intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as president of the united states.
what --
what is that american promise?
it's a promise that says each of us has the freedom to make of our own lives what we will, but that we also have obligations to treat each other with dignity and respect.
it's a promise that says the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth, but that businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create american jobs, to look out for american workers, and play by the rules of the road.
ours -- ours is a promise that says government cannot solve all our problems, but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselves: protect us from harm and provide every child a decent education; keep our water clean and our toys safe; invest in new schools, and new roads, and science, and technology.
our government should work for us, not against us.
it should help us, not hurt us.
it should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence, but for every american who's willing to work.
that's the promise of america, the idea that we are responsible for ourselves, but that we also rise or fall as one nation, the fundamental belief that i am my brother's keeper
, i am my sister's keeper.
that's the promise we need to keep.
that's the change we need right now.
so -- so let me -- let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president.
change means a tax code that doesn't reward the lobbyists who wrote it, but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it.
you know, unlike john mccain, i will stop giving tax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas, and i will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in america.
i'll eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and start-ups that will create the high-wage, high-tech jobs of tomorrow.
i will -- listen now --
i will cut taxes -- cut taxes -- for 95 percent of all working families, because, in an economy like this, the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class.
and for the sake of our economy, our security, and the future of our planet, i will set a clear goal as president: in 10 years, we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east.
we will do this.
washington -- washington has been talking about our oil addiction for the last 30 years.
and, by the way, john mccain has been there for 26 of them.
and in that time, he has said no to higher fuel-efficiency standards for cars, no to investment in renewable energy, no to renewable fuels.
and today, we import triple the amount of oil than we had on the day that senator mccain took office.
now is the time to end this addiction and to understand that drilling is a stop-gap measure, not a long-term solution, not even close.
as president -- as president, i will tap our natural gas reserves, invest in clean coal technology, and find ways to safely harness nuclear power.
i'll help our auto companies re-tool, so that the fuel-efficient cars of the future are built right here in america.
i'll make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars.
and i'll invest 150 billion dollars over the next decade in affordable, renewable sources of energy -- wind power, and solar power, and the next generation of biofuels -- an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and can't be outsourced.
america, now is not the time for small plans.
now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world-class education, because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy.
you know, michelle and i are only here tonight because we were given a chance at an education.
and i will not settle for an america where some kids don't have that chance.
i'll invest in early childhood education.
i'll recruit an army of new teachers, and pay them higher salaries, and give them more support.
and in exchange, i'll ask for higher standards and more accountability.
and we will keep our promise to every young american: if you commit to serving your community or our country, we will make sure you can afford a college education.
now -- now is the time to finally keep the promise of affordable, accessible health care for every single american.
if you have health care -- if you have health care, my plan will lower your premiums.
if you don't, you'll be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of congress give themselves.
and -- and as someone who watched my mother argue with insurance companies while she lay in bed dying of cancer, i will make certain those companies stop discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most.
now is the time to help families with paid sick days and better family leave, because nobody in america should have to choose between keeping their job and caring for a sick child or an ailing parent.
now is the time to change our bankruptcy laws, so that your pensions are protected ahead of ceo bonuses, and the time to protect social security for future generations.
and now is the time to keep the promise of equal pay for an equal day's work, because i want my daughters to have the exact same opportunities as your sons.
now, many of these plans will cost money, which is why i've laid out how i'll pay for every dime: by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that don't help america grow.
but i will also go through the federal budget line by line, eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less, because we cannot meet 21st-century challenges with a 20th-century bureaucracy.
and, democrats -- democrats, we must also admit that fulfilling america's promise will require more than just money.
it will require a renewed sense of responsibility from each of us to recover what john f. kennedy called our intellectual and moral strength.
yes, government must lead on energy independence, but each of us must do our part to make our homes and businesses more efficient.
yes, we must provide more ladders to success for young men who fall into lives of crime and despair.
but we must also admit that programs alone can't replace parents, that government can't turn off the television and make a child do her homework, that fathers must take more responsibility to provide love and guidance to their children.
individual responsibility and mutual responsibility
, that's the essence of america's promise.
and just as we keep our promise to the next generation here at home, so must we keep america's promise abroad.
if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander-in-chief, that's a debate
i'm ready to have.
for -- for while -- while senator mccain was turning his sights to iraq just days after 9/11, i stood up and opposed this war, knowing that it would distract us from the real threats that we face.
when john mccain said we could just muddle through in afghanistan, i argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11, and made clear that we must take out osama bin laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights.
you know, john mccain likes to say that he'll follow bin laden to the gates of hell, but he won't even follow him to the cave where he lives.
and today -- today, as my call for a timeframe to remove our troops from iraq has been echoed by the iraqi government and even the bush administration, even after we learned that iraq has 79 billion dollars in surplus while we are wallowing in deficit, john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war.
that's not the judgment we need; that won't keep america safe.
we need a president who can face the threats of the future, not keep grasping at the ideas of the past.
you don't defeat -- you don't defeat a terrorist network that operates in 80 countries by occupying iraq.
you don't protect israel and deter iran just by talking tough in washington.
you can't truly stand up for georgia when you've strained our oldest alliances.
if john mccain wants to follow george bush with more tough talk and bad strategy, that is his choice, but that is not the change that america needs.
we are the party of roosevelt.
we are the party of kennedy.
so don't tell me that democrats won't defend this country.
don't tell me that democrats won't keep us safe.
the bush-mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans, democrats and republicans, have built, and we are here to restore that legacy.
as commander-in-chief, i will never hesitate to defend this nation, but i will only send our troops into harm's way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home.
i will end this war in iraq responsibly and finish the fight against al qaida and the taliban in afghanistan.
i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts, but i will also renew the tough, direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and curb russian aggression.
i will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century: terrorism and nuclear proliferation, poverty and genocide, climate change and disease.
and i will restore our moral standing so that america is once again that last, best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom, who long for lives of peace, and who yearn for a better future.
these -- these are the policies i will pursue.
and in the weeks ahead, i look forward to debating them with john mccain.
but what i will not do is suggest that the senator takes his positions for political purposes, because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each other's character and each other's patriotism.
the times are too serious; the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook.
so let us agree that patriotism has no party.
i love this country, and so do you, and so does john mccain.
the men and women who serve in our battlefields may be democrats and republicans and independents, but they have fought together, and bled together, and some died together under the same proud flag.
they have not served a red america or a blue america; they have served the united states of america.
so i've got news for you, john mccain: we all put our country first.
america, our work will not be easy.
the challenges we face require tough choices.
and democrats, as well as republicans, will need to cast off the worn-out ideas and politics of the past, for part of what has been lost these past eight years can't just be measured by lost wages or bigger trade deficits.
what has also been lost is our sense of common purpose, and that's what we have to restore.
we may not agree on abortion, but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country.
the -- the reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural ohio than they are for those plagued by gang violence in cleveland, but don't tell me we can't uphold the second amendment while keeping ak-47s out of the hands of criminals.
i know there are differences on same-sex marriage, but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in a hospital and to live lives free of discrimination.
you know, passions may fly on immigration, but i don't know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts american wages by hiring illegal workers.
but this, too, is part of america's promise, the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort.
i know there are those who dismiss such beliefs as happy talk.
they claim that our insistence on something larger, something firmer, and more honest in our public life is just a trojan horse for higher taxes and the abandonment of traditional values.
and that's to be expected, because if you don't have any fresh ideas, then you use stale tactics to scare voters.
if you don't have a record to run on, then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from.
you make a big election about small things.
and you know what?
it's worked before, because it feeds into the cynicism we all have about government.
when washington doesn't work, all its promises seem empty.
if your hopes have been dashed again and again, then it's best to stop hoping and settle for what you already know.
i get it.
i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office.
i don't fit the typical pedigree, and i haven't spent my career in the halls of washington.
but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring.
what the naysayers don't understand is that this election has never been about me; it's about you.
it's about you.
for 18 long months, you have stood up, one by one, and said, "enough," to the politics of the past.
you understand that, in this election, the greatest risk we can take is to try the same, old politics with the same, old players and expect a different result.
you have shown what history teaches us, that at defining moments like this one, the change we need doesn't come from washington.
change comes to washington.
change happens -- change happens because the american people demand it, because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership, a new politics for a new time.
america, this is one of those moments.
i believe that, as hard as it will be, the change we need is coming, because i've seen it, because i've lived it.
because i've seen it in illinois, when we provided health care to more children and moved more families from welfare to work.
i've seen it in washington, where we worked across party lines to open up government and hold lobbyists more accountable, to give better care for our veterans, and keep nuclear weapons out of the hands of terrorists.
and i've seen it in this campaign, in the young people who voted for the first time and the young at heart,
those who got involved again after a very long time; in the republicans who never thought they'd pick up a democratic ballot, but did.
i've seen it
-- i've seen it in the workers who would rather cut their hours back a day, even though they can't afford it, than see their friends lose their jobs; in the soldiers who re-enlist after losing a limb; in the good neighbors who take a stranger in when a hurricane strikes and the floodwaters rise.
you know, this country of ours has more wealth than any nation, but that's not what makes us rich.
we have the most powerful military on earth, but that's not what makes us strong.
our universities and our culture are the envy of the world, but that's not what keeps the world coming to our shores.
instead, it is that american spirit, that american promise, that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain; that binds us together in spite of our differences; that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen, but what is unseen, that better place around the bend.
that promise is our greatest inheritance.
it's a promise i make to my daughters when i tuck them in at night and a promise that you make to yours, a promise that has led immigrants to cross oceans and pioneers to travel west, a promise that led workers to picket lines and women to reach for the ballot.
and it is that promise that, 45 years ago today, brought americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a mall in washington, before lincoln's memorial, and hear a young preacher from georgia speak of his dream.
the men and women who gathered there could've heard many things.
they could've heard words of anger and discord.
they could've been told to succumb to the fear and frustrations of so many dreams deferred.
but what the people heard instead -- people of every creed and color, from every walk of life -- is that, in america, our destiny is inextricably linked, that together our dreams can be one.
"we cannot walk alone," the preacher cried.
"and as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead.
we cannot turn back."
america, we cannot turn back, not with so much work to be done; not with so many children to educate, and so many veterans to care for; not with an economy to fix, and cities to rebuild, and farms to save; not with so many families to protect and so many lives to mend.
america, we cannot turn back.
we cannot walk alone.
at this moment, in this election, we must pledge once more to march into the future.
let us keep that promise, that american promise, and in the words of scripture hold firmly, without wavering, to the hope that we confess.
thank you.
god bless you.
and god bless the united states of america.
thank you to the citizens of berlin and
* -- and thank you to the people of germany.
let me thank chancellor merkel and foreign minister steinmeier for welcoming me earlier today.
thank you mayor wowereit, the berlin senate, the police, and most of all thanks to all of you for this extraordinary welcome.
thank you.
i come to berlin as so many of my countrymen have come before; although tonight, i speak to you not as a candidate for president, but as a citizen -- a proud citizen of the united states, and a fellow citizen of the world.
i know that i don’t look like the americans who’ve previously spoken in this great city.
the journey that led me here is improbable.
my mother was born in the heartland of america, but my father grew up herding goats in kenya.
his father -- his father -- my grandfather -- was a cook, a domestic servant to the british.
at the height of the cold war, my father decided, like so many others in the forgotten corners of the world, that his yearning -- his dream -- required the freedom and opportunity promised by the west.
and so he wrote letter after letter to universities all across america until somebody, somewhere answered his prayer for a better life.
that is why i am here.
and you are here because you too know that yearning.
this city, of all cities, knows the dream of freedom.
and you know that the only reason we stand here tonight is because men and women from both of our nations came together to work, and struggle, and sacrifice for that better life.
ours is a partnership that truly began 60 years ago this summer, on the day when the first american plane touched down at tempelhof.
on that day -- on that day much of this continent still lay in ruin.
the rubble of this city had yet to be built into a wall.
the soviet shadow had swept across eastern europe, while in the west, america, britain, and france took their stock of their losses, and pondered how the world might be remade.
this is where the two sides met.
and on the twenty-fourth of june, 1948, the communists chose to blockade the western part of the city.
they cut off food and supplies to more than two million germans in an effort to extinguish the last flame of freedom in berlin.
the size of our forces was no match for the larger soviet army.
and yet retreat would have allowed communism to march across europe.
where the last war had ended, another world war could have easily begun.
and all that stood in the way was berlin.
and that’s when -- that's when the airlift began, when the largest and most unlikely rescue in the history brought food and hope to the people of this city.
the odds were stacked against success.
in the winter, a heavy fog filled the sky above, and many planes were forced to turn back without dropping off the needed supplies.
the streets where we stand were filled with hungry families who had no comfort from the cold.
but in the darkest hours, the people of berlin kept the flame of hope burning.
the people of berlin refused to give up.
and on one fall day, hundreds of thousands of berliners came here, to the tiergarten, and heard the city
’s mayor implore the world not to give up on freedom.
“there is only one possibility,” he said.
“for us to stand together united until this battle is won…the people of berlin have spoken.
we have done our duty," he said, "and we will keep on doing our duty.
people of the world, now do your duty.
people of the world, look at berlin.”
people of the world -- look at berlin!
look at berlin, where germans and americans learned to work together and trust each other less than three years after facing each other on the field of battle.
look at berlin, where the determination of a people met the generosity of the marshall plan and created a german miracle; where a -- where a victory over tyranny gave rise to nato, the greatest alliance ever formed to defend our common security.
look at berlin, where the bullet holes in the buildings and the somber stones and pillars near the brandenburg gate insist that we never forget our common humanity.
people of the world -- look at berlin, where a wall came down, a continent came together, and history proved that there is no challenge too great for a world that stands as one.
sixty years after the airlift, we are called upon again.
history has led us to a new crossroad, with new promise and new peril.
when you, the german people, tore down that wall -- a wall that divided east and west; freedom and tyranny; fear and hope -- walls came tumbling down around the world.
from kiev to cape town, prison camps were closed, and the doors of democracy were opened.
markets opened too, and the spread of information and technology reduced barriers to opportunity and prosperity.
while the 20th century taught us that we share a common destiny, the 21st century has revealed a world more intertwined than at any time in human history.
the fall of the berlin wall brought new hope.
but that very closeness has given rise to new dangers -- dangers that cannot be contained within the borders of a country or by the distance of an ocean.
think about it: the terrorists of september 11th plotted in hamburg and trained in kandahar and karachi before killing thousands from all over the globe on american soil.
as we speak, cars in boston and factories in beijing are melting the ice caps in the arctic, shrinking coastlines in the atlantic, and bringing drought to farms from kansas to kenya.
poorly secured nuclear material in the former soviet union, or secrets from a scientist in pakistan could help build a bomb that detonates in paris.
the poppies in afghanistan come to berlin in the form of the heroin.
the poverty and violence in somalia breeds the terror of tomorrow.
the genocide in darfur shames the conscience of us all.
in this new world, such dangerous currents have swept along faster than our efforts to contain them.
and that is why we cannot afford to be divided.
no one nation, no matter how large or powerful, can defeat such challenges alone.
none of us can deny these threats, or escape responsi[bility] in meeting them.
in the absence of soviet tanks and a terrible wall, it has become easy to forget this truth.
and if we’re honest with each other, we know that sometimes, on both sides of the atlantic, we have drifted apart, and forgotten our shared destiny.
in europe, the view that america is part of what has gone wrong in our world, rather than a force to help us make it right, has become all too common.
in america, there are voices that deride and deny the importance of europe
’s role in our security and our future.
both views miss the truth: that europeans today are bearing new burdens and taking more responsibility in critical parts of the world; and that just as american bases built in the last century still help to defend the security of this continent, so does our country still sacrifice greatly for freedom around the globe.
yes, there have been differences between america and europe.
no doubt, there will be differences in the future.
but the burdens of global citizenship continue to bind us together.
a change of leadership in washington will not lift this burden.
in this new century, americans and europeans alike will be required to do more -- not less.
partnership and cooperation among nations is not a choice; it is the only way, the one way, to protect our common security and advance our common humanity.
that is why the greatest danger of all is to allow new walls to divide us from one another.
the walls between old allies on either side of the atlantic cannot stand.
the walls between the countries with the most and those with the least cannot stand.
the walls between races and tribes; natives and immigrants; christians and muslims and jews cannot stand.
these now are the walls we must tear down.
we know -- we know that these walls have fallen before.
after centuries of strife, the people of europe have formed a union of promise and prosperity.
here, at the base of a column built to mark victory in war, we meet in the center of a europe at peace.
not only have walls come down in berlin, but they've come down in belfast, where protestant and catholic found a way to live together; in the balkans, where our atlantic alliance ended wars and brought savage war criminals to justice; and in south africa, where the struggle of a courageous people defeated apartheid.
so history reminds us that walls can be torn down.
but the task is never easy.
true partnership and true progress requires constant work and sustained sacrifice.
they require sharing the burdens of development and diplomacy; of peace and progress.
they require allies who will listen to each other, learn from each other and, most of all, trust each other.
that is why america cannot turn inward.
that is why europe cannot turn inward.
america has no better partner than europe.
now -- now is the time to build new bridges across the globe as strong as the one that binds us across the atlantic.
now is the time to join together, through constant cooperation and strong institutions and shared sacrifice and a global commitment to progress, to meet the challenges of the 21st century.
it was this spirit that led airlift planes to appear in the sky above our heads, and people to assemble where we stand today.
and this is the moment when our nations -- and all nations -- must summon that spirit anew.
this is the moment when we must defeat terror and dry up the well of extremism that supports it.
this threat is real and we cannot shrink from our responsibility to combat it.
if we could create nato to face down the soviet union, we can join in a new and global partnership to dismantle the networks that have struck in madrid and amman; in london and bali; in washington and new york.
if we could win a battle of ideas against the communists, we can stand with the vast majority of muslims who reject the extremism that leads to hate instead of hope.
this is the moment when we must renew our resolve to rout the terrorists who threaten our security in afghanistan, and the traffickers who sell drugs on your streets.
no one welcomes war.
i recognize the enormous difficulties in afghanistan.
but my country and yours have a stake in seeing that nato’s first mission beyond europe
’s
borders is a success.
for the people of afghanistan, and for our shared security, the work must be done.
america can't do this alone.
the afghan people need our troops and your troops; our support and your support to defeat the taliban and al qaeda, to develop their economy, and to help them rebuild their nation.
we have too much at stake to turn back now.
this
-- this is the moment when we must renew the goal of a world without nuclear weapons.
the two superpowers that faced each other across the wall of this city came too close too often to destroying all we have built and all that we love.
with that wall gone, we need not stand idly by and watch the further spread of the deadly atom.
it is time to secure all loose nuclear materials; to stop the spread of nuclear weapons; and to reduce the arsenals from another era.
this is the moment to begin the work of seeking the peace of a world without nuclear weapons.
this is the moment when every nation in europe must have the chance to choose its own tomorrow, free from the shadows of yesterday.
in this century, we need a strong european union that deepens the security and prosperity of this continent, while extending a hand abroad.
in this century -- in this city of all cities -- we must reject the cold war mind-set of the past, and resolve to work with russia when we can, to stand up for our values when we must, and to seek a partnership that extends across this entire continent.
this is the moment when we must build on the wealth that opens [sic] markets have created, and share its benefits more equitably.
trade has been a cornerstone of our growth and global development.
but we will not be able to sustain this growth if it favors the few, and not the many.
together -- together we must forge trade that truly rewards the work that creates wealth, with meaningful protections for our people and our planet.
this is the moment for trade that is free and fair for all.
this is the moment we must help answer the call for a new dawn in the middle east.
my country must stand with yours and with europe in sending a direct message to iran that it must abandon its nuclear ambitions.
we must support the lebanese who've marched and bled for democracy, and the israelis and the palestinians who seek a secure and lasting peace.
and despite -- despite past differences, this is the moment when the world should support the millions of iraqis who seek to rebuild their lives, even as we pass responsibility to the iraqi government and finally bring this war to a close.
this
-- this is the moment when we must come together to save this planet.
let us resolve that we will not leave our children to a world where the oceans rise and famine spreads and terrible storms devastate our lands.
let us resolve that all nations -- including my own -- will act with the same seriousness of purpose as has your nation, and reduce the carbon we send into our atmosphere.
this -- this is the moment to give our children back their future.
this is the moment to stand as one.
and this is the moment when we must give hope to those left behind in a globalized world.
we must remember that the cold war born in this city was not a battle for land or treasure.
sixty years ago, the planes that flew over berlin did not drop bombs; instead they delivered food, and coal, and candy to grateful children.
and in that show of solidarity, those pilots won more than a military victory.
they won hearts and minds; love and loyalty and trust -- not just from the people in this city, but from all those who heard the story of what they did here.
now the world will watch and remember what we do here -- what we do with this moment.
will we extend our hand to the people in the forgotten corners of this world who yearn for lives marked by dignity and opportunity, by security and justice?
will we lift the child in bangladesh from poverty, and shelter the refugee in chad, and banish the scourge of aids in our time?
will we stand for the human rights of the dissident in burma, the blogger in iran, or the voter in zimbabwe?
will we give meaning to the words “never again” in darfur?
will we acknowledge --
will we acknowledge that there is no more powerful example than the one each of our nations projects to the world?
will we reject torture and stand for the rule of law?
will we --
will we -- will we welcome immigrants from different lands, and shun discrimination against those who don’t look like us or worship like we do, and keep the promise of equality and opportunity for all of our people?
people of berlin -- people of the world -- this is our moment.
this is our time.
i know my country has not perfected itself.
at times, we’ve struggled to keep the promise of liberty and equality for all of our people.
we’ve made our share of mistakes, and there are times when our actions around the world have not lived up to our best intentions.
but i also know how much i love america.
i know that for more than two centuries, we have strived -- at great cost and great sacrifice -- to form a more perfect union; to seek, with other nations, a more hopeful world.
our allegiance has never been to any particular tribe or kingdom -- indeed, every language is spoken in our country; every culture has left its imprint on ours; every point of view is expressed in our public squares.
what has always united us, what has always driven our people, what drew my father to america
’s shores -- is a set of ideals that speak to aspirations shared by all people: that we can live free from fear and free from want; that we can speak our minds and assemble with whomever we choose and worship as we please.
these are the aspiration[s]
that join the fates of all nations in this city.
these aspirations are bigger than anything that drives us apart.
it is because of these aspirations that the airlift began.
it is because of these aspirations that all free people -- everywhere -- became citizens of berlin.
it is in pursuit of these aspirations that a new generation -- our generation -- must make our mark on the world.
people of berlin -- and people of the world -- the scale of our challenge is great.
the road ahead will be long.
but i come before you to say that we are heirs to a struggle for freedom.
we are a people of improbable hope.
with an eye toward the future, with resolve in our heart, let us remember this history, and answer our destiny, and remake the world once again.
thank you, berlin.
god bless you.
thank you.
thank you.
sixty-one years ago, george marshall announced the plan that would come to bear his name.
much of europe lay in ruins.
the united states faced a powerful and ideological enemy intent on world domination.
this menace was magnified by the recently discovered capability to destroy life on an unimaginable scale.
the soviet union didn't yet have an atomic bomb, but before long it would.
the challenge facing the greatest generation of americans -- the generation that had vanquished fascism on the battlefield -- was how to contain this threat while extending freedom's frontiers.
leaders like truman and acheson, kennan and marshall, knew that there was no single decisive blow that could be struck for freedom.
we needed a new overarching strategy to meet the challenges of a new and dangerous world.
such a strategy would join overwhelming military strength with sound judgment.
it would shape events not just through military force, but through the force of our ideas; through economic power, intelligence and diplomacy.
it would support strong allies that freely shared our ideals of liberty and democracy; open markets and the rule of law.
it would foster new international institutions like the united nations, nato, and the world bank, and focus on every corner of the globe.
it was a strategy that saw clearly the world's dangers, while seizing its promise.
as a general, marshall had spent years helping fdr wage war.
but the marshall plan -- which was just one part of this strategy -- helped rebuild not just allies, but also the nation that marshall had plotted to defeat.
in the speech announcing his plan, he concluded not with tough talk or definitive declarations -- but rather with questions and a call for perspective.
"the whole world of the future," marshall said, "hangs on a proper judgment."
to make that judgment, he asked the american people to examine distant events that directly affected their security and prosperity.
he closed by asking: "what is needed?
what can best be done?
what must be done?"
what is needed?
what can best be done?
what must be done?
today's dangers are different, though no less grave.
the power to destroy life on a catastrophic scale now risks falling into the hands of terrorists.
the future of our security -- and our planet -- is held hostage to our dependence on foreign oil and gas.
from the cave- spotted mountains of northwest pakistan, to the centrifuges spinning beneath iranian soil, we know that the american people cannot be protected by oceans or the sheer might of our military alone.
the attacks of september 11 brought this new reality into a terrible and ominous focus.
on that bright and beautiful day, the world of peace and prosperity that was the legacy of our cold war victory seemed to suddenly vanish under rubble, and twisted steel, and clouds of smoke.
but the depth of this tragedy also drew out the decency and determination of our nation.
at blood banks and vigils; in schools and in the united states congress, americans were united -- more united, even, than we were at the dawn of the cold war.
the world, too, was united against the perpetrators of this evil act, as old allies, new friends, and even long-time adversaries stood by our side.
it was time -- once again -- for america's might and moral suasion to be harnessed; it was time to once again shape a new security strategy for an ever-changing world.
imagine, for a moment, what we could have done in those days, and months, and years after 9/11.
we could have deployed the full force of american power to hunt down and destroy osama bin laden, al qaida, the taliban, and all of the terrorists responsible for 9/11, while supporting real security in afghanistan.
we could have secured loose nuclear materials around the world, and updated a 20th century non-proliferation framework to meet the challenges of the 21st.
we could have invested hundreds of billions of dollars in alternative sources of energy to grow our economy, save our planet, and end the tyranny of oil.
we could have strengthened old alliances, formed new partnerships, and renewed international institutions to advance peace and prosperity.
we could have called on a new generation to step into the strong currents of history, and to serve their country as troops and teachers, peace corps volunteers and police officers.
we could have secured our homeland -- investing in sophisticated new protection for our ports, our trains and our power plants.
we could have rebuilt our roads and bridges, laid down new rail and broadband and electricity systems, and made college affordable for every american to strengthen our ability to compete.
we could have done that.
instead, we have lost thousands of american lives, spent nearly a trillion dollars, alienated allies and neglected emerging threats -- all in the cause of fighting a war for well over five years in a country that had absolutely nothing to do with the 9/11 attacks.
our men and women in uniform have accomplished every mission we have given them.
what's missing in our debate about iraq -- what has been missing since before the war began -- is a discussion of the strategic consequences of iraq and its dominance of our foreign policy.
this war distracts us from every threat that we face and
so many opportunities we could seize.
this war diminishes our security, our standing in the world, our military, our economy, and the resources that we need to confront the challenges of the 21st century.
by any measure, our single-minded and open-ended focus on iraq is not a sound strategy for keeping america safe.
i am running for president of the united states to lead this country in a new direction -- to seize this moment's promise.
instead of being distracted from the most pressing threats that we face, i want to overcome them.
instead of pushing the entire burden of our foreign policy on to the brave men and women of our military, i want to use all elements of american power to keep us safe, and prosperous, and free.
instead of alienating ourselves from the world, i want america -- once again -- to lead.
as president, i will pursue a tough, smart and principled national security strategy -- one that recognizes that we have interests not just in baghdad, but in kandahar and karachi, in tokyo and london, in beijing and berlin.
i will focus this strategy on five goals essential to making america safer: ending the war in iraq responsibly; finishing the fight against al qaida and the taliban; securing all nuclear weapons and materials from terrorists and rogue states; achieving true energy security; and rebuilding our alliances to meet the challenges of the 21st century.
my opponent in this campaign has served this country with honor, and we all respect his sacrifice.
we both want to do what we think is best to defend the american people.
but we've made different judgments, and would lead in very different directions.
that starts with iraq.
i opposed going to war in iraq; senator mccain was one of washington's biggest supporters for war.
i warned that the invasion of a country posing no imminent threat would fan the flames of extremism, and distract us from the fight against al qaida and the taliban; senator mccain claimed that we would be greeted as liberators, and that democracy would spread across the middle east.
those were the judgments we made on the most important strategic question since the end of the cold war.
now, all of us recognize that we must do more than look back -- we must make a judgment about how to move forward.
what is needed?
what can best be done?
what must be done?
senator mccain wants to talk of our tactics in iraq; i want to focus on a new strategy for iraq and the wider world.
it has been 18 months since president bush announced the surge.
as i have said many times, our troops have performed brilliantly in lowering the level of violence.
general petraeus has used new tactics to protect the iraqi population.
we have talked directly to sunni tribes that used to be hostile to america, and supported their fight against al qaida.
shiite militias have generally respected a cease- fire.
those are the facts, and all americans welcome them.
for weeks, now, senator mccain has argued that the gains of the surge mean that i should change my commitment to end the war.
but this argument misconstrues what is necessary to succeed in iraq, and stubbornly ignores the facts of the broader strategic picture that we face.
in the 18 months since the surge began, the strain on our military has increased, our troops and their families have borne an enormous burden, and american taxpayers have spent another $200 billion in iraq.
that's over $10 billion each month.
that is a consequence of our current strategy.
in the 18 months since the surge began, the situation in afghanistan has deteriorated.
june was our highest casualty month of the war.
the taliban has been on the offensive, even launching a brazen attack on one of our bases.
al qaida has a growing sanctuary in pakistan.
that is a consequence of our current strategy.
in the 18 months since the surge began, as i warned at the outset -- iraq's leaders have not made the political progress that was the purpose of the surge.
they have not invested tens of billions of dollars in oil revenues to rebuild their country.
they have not resolved their differences or shaped a new political compact.
that's why i strongly stand by my plan to end this war.
now, prime minister maliki's call for a timetable for the removal of u.s. forces presents a real opportunity.
it comes at a time when the american general in charge of training iraq's security forces has testified that iraq's army and police will be ready to assume responsibility for iraq's security in 2009.
now is the time for a responsible redeployment of our combat troops that pushes iraq's leaders toward a political solution, rebuilds our military, and refocuses on afghanistan and our broader security interests.
george bush and john mccain don't have a strategy for success in iraq -- they have a strategy for staying in iraq.
they said we couldn't leave when violence was up
, they say we can't leave when violence is down.
they refuse to press the iraqis to make tough choices, and they label any timetable to redeploy our troops "surrender," even though we would be turning iraq over to a sovereign iraqi government -- not to a terrorist enemy.
theirs is an endless focus on tactics inside iraq, with no consideration of our strategy to face threats beyond iraq's borders.
at some point, a judgment must be made.
iraq is not going to be a perfect place, and we don't have unlimited resources to try to make it one.
we are not going to kill every al qaida sympathizer, eliminate every trace of iranian influence, or stand up a flawless democracy before we leave -- general petraeus and ambassador crocker acknowledged this to me when they testified last april.
that is why the accusation of surrender is false rhetoric used to justify a failed policy.
in fact, true success in iraq -- victory in iraq -- will not take place in a surrender ceremony where an enemy lays down their arms.
true success will take place when we leave iraq to a government that is taking responsibility for its future -- a government that prevents sectarian conflict, and ensures that the al qaida threat which has been beaten back by our troops does not reemerge.
that is an achievable goal if we pursue a comprehensive plan to press the iraqis stand up.
to achieve that success, i will give our military a new mission on my first day in office: ending this war.
let me be clear: we must be as careful getting out of iraq as we were careless getting in.
we can safely redeploy our combat brigades at a pace that would remove them in 16 months.
that would be the summer of 2010 -- one year after iraqi security forces will be prepared to stand up; two years from now, and more than seven years after the war began.
after this redeployment, we'll keep a residual force to perform specific missions in iraq: targeting any remnants of al qaida; protecting our service members and diplomats; and training and supporting iraq's security forces, so long as the iraqis make political progress.
we will make tactical adjustments as we implement this strategy -- that is what any responsible commander-in-chief must do.
as i have consistently said, i will consult with commanders on the ground and the iraqi government.
we will redeploy from secure areas first and volatile areas later.
we will commit $2 billion to a meaningful international effort to support the more than 4 million displaced iraqis.
we will forge a new coalition to support iraq's future -- one that includes all of iraq's neighbors, and also the united nations, the world bank, and the european union -- because we all have a stake in stability.
and we will make it clear that the united states seeks no permanent bases in iraq.
this is the future that iraqis want.
this is the future that the american people want.
and this is what our common interests demand.
both america and iraq will be more secure when the terrorist in anbar is taken out by the iraqi army, and the criminal in baghdad fears iraqi police, not just coalition forces.
both america and iraq will succeed when every arab government has an embassy open in baghdad, and the child in basra benefits from services provided by iraqi dinars, not american tax dollars.
and this is the future we need for our military.
we cannot tolerate this strain on our forces to fight a war that hasn't made us safer.
i will restore our strength by ending this war, completing the increase of our ground forces by 65,000 soldiers and 27,000 marines, and investing in the capabilities we need to defeat conventional foes and meet the unconventional challenges of our time.
so let's be clear.
senator mccain would have our troops continue to fight tour after tour of duty, and our taxpayers keep spending $10 billion a month indefinitely; i want iraqis to take responsibility for their own future, and to reach the political accommodation necessary for long-term stability.
that's victory.
that's success.
that's what's best for iraq, that's what's best for america, and that's why i will end this war as president.
in fact -- as should have been apparent to president bush and senator mccain -- the central front in the war on terror is not iraq, and it never was.
that's why the second goal of my new strategy will be taking the fight to al qaida in afghanistan and pakistan.
it is unacceptable that almost seven years after nearly 3,000 americans were killed on our soil, the terrorists who attacked us on 9/11 are still at large.
osama bin laden and ayman al-zawahari are recording messages to their followers and plotting more terror.
the taliban controls parts of afghanistan.
al qaida has an expanding base in pakistan that is probably no farther from their old afghan sanctuary than a train ride from washington to philadelphia.
if another attack on our homeland comes, it will likely come from the same region where 9/11 was planned.
and yet today, we have five times more troops in iraq than afghanistan.
senator mccain said -- just months ago -- that "afghanistan is not in trouble because of our diversion to iraq.
" i could not disagree more.
our troops and our nato allies are performing heroically in afghanistan, but i have argued for years that we lack the resources to finish the job because of our commitment to iraq.
that's what the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff said earlier this month.
and that's why, as president, i will make the fight against al qaida and the taliban the top priority that it should be.
this is a war that we have to win.
i will send at least two additional combat brigades to afghanistan, and use this commitment to seek greater contributions -- with fewer restrictions -- from nato allies.
i will focus on training afghan security forces and supporting an afghan judiciary, with more resources and incentives for american officers who perform these missions.
just as we succeeded in the cold war by supporting allies who could sustain their own security, we must realize that the 21st century's front lines are not only on the field of battle -- they are found in the training exercise near kabul, in the police station in kandahar, and in the rule of law in herat.
moreover, lasting security will only come if we heed marshall's lesson, and help afghans grow their economy from the bottom up.
that's why i've proposed an additional $1 billion in non-military assistance each year, with meaningful safeguards to prevent corruption and to make sure investments are made -- not just in kabul -- but out in afghanistan's provinces.
as a part of this program, we'll invest in alternative livelihoods to poppy-growing for afghan farmers, just as we crack down on heroin trafficking.
we cannot lose afghanistan to a future of narco-terrorism.
the afghan people must know that our commitment to their future is enduring, because the security of afghanistan and the united states is shared.
the greatest threat to that security lies in the tribal regions of pakistan, where terrorists train and insurgents strike into afghanistan.
we cannot tolerate a terrorist sanctuary, and as president, i won't.
we need a stronger and sustained partnership between afghanistan, pakistan and nato to secure the border, to take out terrorist camps, and to crack down on cross-border insurgents.
we need more troops, more helicopters, more satellites, more predator drones in the afghan border region.
and we must make it clear that if pakistan cannot or will not act, we will take out high-level terrorist targets like bin laden if we have them in our sights.
make no mistake
: we can't succeed in afghanistan or secure our homeland unless we change our pakistan policy.
we must expect more of the pakistani government, but we must offer more than a blank check to a general who has lost the confidence of his people.
it's time to strengthen stability by standing up for the aspirations of the pakistani people.
that's why i'm cosponsoring a bill with joe biden and richard lugar to triple non-military aid to the pakistani people and to sustain it for a decade, while ensuring that the military assistance we do provide is used to take the fight to the taliban and al qaida.
we must move beyond a purely military alliance built on convenience, or face mounting popular opposition in a nuclear-armed nation at the nexus of terror and radical islam.
only a strong pakistani democracy can help us move toward my third goal -- securing all nuclear weapons and materials from terrorists and rogue states.
one of the terrible ironies of the iraq war is that president bush used the threat of nuclear terrorism to invade a country that had no active nuclear program.
but the fact that the president misled us into a misguided war doesn't diminish the threat of a terrorist with a weapon of mass destruction -- in fact, it has only increased it.
in those years after world war ii, we worried about the deadly atom falling into the hands of the kremlin.
now, we worry about 50 tons of highly enriched uranium -- some of it poorly secured -- at civilian nuclear facilities in over forty countries.
now, we worry about the breakdown of a non-proliferation framework that was designed for the bipolar world of the cold war.
now, we worry -- most of all -- about a rogue state or nuclear scientist transferring the world's deadliest weapons to the world's most dangerous people: terrorists who won't think twice about killing themselves and hundreds of thousands in tel aviv or moscow, in london or new york.
we cannot wait any longer to protect the american people.
i've made this a priority in the senate, where i worked with republican senator dick lugar to pass a law accelerating our pursuit of loose nuclear materials.
i'll lead a global effort to secure all loose nuclear materials around the world during my first term as president.
and i'll develop new defenses to protect against the 21st century threat of biological weapons and cyber-terrorism -- threats that i'll discuss in more detail tomorrow.
beyond taking these immediate, urgent steps, it's time to send a clear message: america seeks a world with no nuclear weapons.
as long as nuclear weapons exist, we must retain a strong deterrent.
but instead of threatening to kick them out of the g-8, we need to work with russia to take u.s. and russian ballistic missiles off hair- trigger alert; to dramatically reduce the stockpiles of our nuclear weapons and material; to seek a global ban on the production of fissile material for weapons; and to expand the u.s.-russian ban on intermediate-range missiles so that the agreement is global.
by keeping our commitment under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, we'll be in a better position to press nations like north korea and iran to keep theirs.
in particular, it will give us more credibility and leverage in dealing with iran.
we cannot tolerate nuclear weapons in the hands of nations that support terror.
preventing iran from developing nuclear weapons is a vital national security interest of the united states.
no tool of statecraft should be taken off the table, but senator mccain would continue a failed policy that has seen iran strengthen its position, advance its nuclear program, and stockpile 150 kilos of low enriched uranium.
i will use all elements of american power to pressure the iranian regime, starting with aggressive, principled and direct diplomacy -- diplomacy backed with strong sanctions and without preconditions.
there will be careful preparation.
i commend the work of our european allies on this important matter, and we should be full partners in that effort.
ultimately the measure of any effort is whether it leads to a change in iranian behavior.
that's why we must pursue these tough negotiations in full coordination with our allies, bringing to bear our full influence -- including, if it will advance our interests, my meeting with the appropriate iranian leader at a time and place of my choosing.
we will pursue this diplomacy with no illusions about the iranian regime.
instead, we will present a clear choice.
if you abandon your nuclear program, support for terror, and threats to israel, there will be meaningful incentives.
if you refuse, then we will ratchet up the pressure, with stronger unilateral sanctions; stronger multilateral sanctions in the security council, and sustained action outside the un to isolate the iranian regime.
that's the diplomacy we need.
and the iranians should negotiate now; by waiting, they will only face mounting pressure.
the surest way to increase our leverage against iran in the long- run is to stop bankrolling its ambitions.
that will depend on achieving my fourth goal: ending the tyranny of oil in our time.
one of the most dangerous weapons in the world today is the price of oil.
we ship nearly $700 million a day to unstable or hostile nations for their oil.
it pays for terrorist bombs going off from baghdad to beirut.
it funds petro-diplomacy in caracas and radical madrasas from karachi to khartoum.
it takes leverage away from america and shifts it to dictators.
this immediate danger is eclipsed only by the long-term threat from climate change, which will lead to devastating weather patterns, terrible storms, drought, and famine.
that means people competing for food and water in the next fifty years in the very places that have known horrific violence in the last fifty: africa, the middle east, and south asia.
most disastrously, that could mean destructive storms on our shores, and the disappearance of our coastline.
this is not just an economic issue or an environmental concern -- this is a national security crisis.
for the sake of our security -- and for every american family that is paying the price at the pump -- we must end this dependence on foreign oil.
and as president, that's exactly what i'll do.
small steps and political gimmickry just won't do.
i'll invest $150 billion over the next ten years to put america on the path to true energy security.
this fund will fast track investments in a new green energy business sector that will end our addiction to oil and create up to 5 million jobs over the next two decades, and help secure the future of our country and our planet.
we'll invest in research and development of every form of alternative energy -- solar, wind, and biofuels, as well as technologies that can make coal clean and nuclear power safe.
and from the moment i take office, i will let it be known that the united states of america is ready to lead again.
never again will we sit on the sidelines, or stand in the way of global action to tackle this global challenge.
i will reach out to the leaders of the biggest carbon emitting nations and ask them to join a new global energy forum that will lay the foundation for the next generation of climate protocols.
we will also build an alliance of oil-importing nations and work together to reduce our demand, and to break the grip of opec on the global economy.
we'll set a goal of an 80% reduction in global emissions by 2050.
and as we develop new forms of clean energy here at home, we will share our technology and our innovations with all the nations of the world.
that is the tradition of american leadership on behalf of the global good.
and that will be my fifth goal -- rebuilding our alliances to meet the common challenges of the 21st century.
for all of our power, america is strongest when we act alongside strong partners.
we faced down fascism with the greatest war-time alliance the world has ever known.
we stood shoulder to shoulder with our nato allies against the soviet threat, and paid a far smaller price for the first gulf war because we acted together with a broad coalition.
we helped create the united nations -- not to constrain america's influence, but to amplify it by advancing our values.
now is the time for a new era of international cooperation.
it's time for america and europe to renew our common commitment to face down the threats of the 21st century just as we did the challenges of the 20th.
it's time to strengthen our partnerships with japan, south korea, australia and the world's largest democracy -- india -- to create a stable and prosperous asia.
it's time to engage china on common interests like climate change, even as we continue to encourage their shift to a more open and market-based society.
it's time to strengthen nato by asking more of our allies, while always approaching them with the respect owed a partner.
it's time to reform the united nations, so that this imperfect institution can become a more perfect forum to share burdens, strengthen our leverage, and promote our values.
it's time to deepen our engagement to help resolve the arab- israeli conflict, so that we help our ally israel achieve true and lasting security, while helping palestinians achieve their legitimate aspirations for statehood.
and just as we renew longstanding efforts, so must we shape new ones to meet new challenges.
that's why i'll create a shared security partnership program -- a new alliance of nations to strengthen cooperative efforts to take down global terrorist networks, while standing up against torture and brutality.
that's why we'll work with the african union to enhance its ability to keep the peace.
that's why we'll build a new partnership to roll back the trafficking of drugs, and guns, and gangs in the americas.
that's what we can do if we are ready to engage the world.
we will have to provide meaningful resources to meet critical priorities.
i know development assistance is not the most popular program, but as president, i will make the case to the american people that it can be our best investment in increasing the common security of the entire world.
that was true with the marshall plan, and that must be true today.
that's why i'll double our foreign assistance to $50 billion by 2012, and use it to support a stable future in failing states, and sustainable growth in africa; to halve global poverty and to roll back disease.
to send once more a message to those yearning faces beyond our shores that says, "you matter to us.
your future is our future.
and our moment is now."
this must be the moment when we answer the call of history.
for eight years, we have paid the price for a foreign policy that lectures without listening; that divides us from one another -- and from the world -- instead of calling us to a common purpose; that focuses on our tactics in fighting a war without end in iraq instead of forging a new strategy to face down the true threats that we face.
we cannot afford four more years of a strategy that is out of balance and out of step with this defining moment.
none of this will be easy, but we have faced great odds before.
when general marshall first spoke about the plan that would bear his name, the rubble of berlin had not yet been built into a wall.
but marshall knew that even the fiercest of adversaries could forge bonds of friendship founded in freedom.
he had the confidence to know that the purpose and pragmatism of the american people could outlast any foe.
today, the dangers and divisions that came with the dawn of the cold war have receded.
now, the defeat of the threats of the past has been replaced by the transnational threats of today.
we know what is needed.
we know what can best be done.
we know what must done.
now it falls to us to act with the same sense of purpose and pragmatism as an earlier generation, to join with friends and partners to lead the world anew.
thank you....
thank you.
what a --
what a wonderful reception.
thank you, saint paul.
thank you, minnesota.
thank you, joann syverson, for the wonderful introduction.
thank you, michelle obama and malia obama and sasha obama.
thank you to my brothers and sisters.
thank you to -- thank you to my staff.
thank you to our volunteers.
thank you to my political team.
thank you to our campaign manager, david plouffe, who never gets any credit, but has built the best political organization in the country.
thank you to my grandmother, who helped raise me, and is sitting in hawaii somewhere right now because she can't travel, but who poured everything she had into me, and who helped to make me the man i am today.
tonight is for her.
tonight, minnesota, after 54 hard-fought contests, our primary season has finally come to an end.
sixteen
-- sixteen months have passed since we first stood together on the steps of the old state capitol in springfield, illinois.
thousands of miles have been traveled; millions of voices have been heard.
and because of what you said, because you decided that change must come to washington, because you believed that this year must be different than all the rest, because -- because you chose to listen not to your doubts or your fears, but to your greatest hopes and highest aspirations, tonight we mark the end of one historic journey with the beginning of another, a journey -- a journey that will bring a new and better day to america.
because of you, tonight i can stand here and say that i will be the democratic nominee for the president of the united states of america.
i want to -- i want to thank -- i want to thank -- i want to thank all those in montana and south dakota who stood up for change today.
i want to thank every american who stood with us over the course of this campaign, through the good days and the bad, from the snows of cedar rapids to the sunshine of sioux falls.
and, tonight, i also want to thank the men and woman who took this journey with me as fellow candidates for president.
you know, at this defining moment -- at this defining moment for our nation, we should be proud that our party put forth one of the most talented, qualified field of individuals ever to run for office.
i have not just competed with them as rivals.
i’ve learned from them as friends, as public servants, and as patriots who love america and are willing to work tirelessly to make this country better.
they are leaders of this party and leaders that america will turn to for years to come.
and that is particularly true for the candidate who has traveled further on this journey than anyone else: senator hillary clinton has made history in this campaign.
she has made history not -- not just because she’s a woman who has done what no woman has done before, but because she is a leader who inspires millions of americans with her strength, her courage, and her commitment to the causes that brought us here tonight.
i congratulate her on her victory in south dakota, and i congratulate her on the race that she has run throughout this contest.
we’ve certainly had our differences over the last 16 months.
but as someone who’s shared a stage with her many times, i can tell you that what gets hillary clinton up in the morning -- even in the face of tough odds -- is exactly what sent her and bill clinton to sign up for their first campaign in texas all those years ago, what sent her to work at the children’s defense fund and made her fight for health care as first lady, what led her to the united states senate and fueled her barrier-breaking campaign for the presidency: an unyielding desire to improve the lives of ordinary americans, no matter how difficult the fight may be.
and you can rest
assured that when we finally win the battle for universal health care in this country -- and we will win that fight -- she will be central to that victory.
when we transform our energy policy and lift our children out of poverty, it will be because she worked to help make it happen.
our party and our country are better off because of her, and i am a better candidate for having had the honor to compete with hillary rodham clinton.
there are those who say that this primary has somehow left us weaker and more divided.
well, i say that, because of this primary, there are millions of americans who've cast their ballot for the very first time.
there are -- there are independents and republicans who understand this election isn’t just about a change of party in washington, but also about the need to change washington.
there are -- there are young people, and african-americans, and hispanic-americans, and women of all ages who have voted in numbers that have broken records and inspired a nation.
all of you chose to support a candidate you believe in deeply.
but at the end of the day, we aren’t the reason you came out and waited in lines that stretched block after block to make your voice heard.
you didn’t do that -- you didn’t do that because of me or senator clinton or anyone else.
you did it because you know in your hearts that at this moment, a moment that will define a generation, we cannot afford to keep doing what we’ve been doing.
we owe our children a better future.
we owe our country a better future.
and for all those who dream of that future tonight, i say: let us begin the work together.
let us unite in common effort to chart a new course for america.
in just -- in just a few short months, the republican party will arrive in st. paul with a very different agenda.
they will -- they will come here to nominate john mccain, a man who has served this country heroically.
i honor, we honor the service of john mccain, and i respect his many accomplishments, even if he chooses to deny mine.
my -- my differences with him -- my differences with him are not personal.
they are with the policies he has proposed in this campaign, because while john mccain can legitimately tout moments of independence from his party in the past, such independence has not been the hallmark of his presidential campaign.
it’s not change when john mccain decided to stand with george bush 95 percent of the time, as he did in the senate last year.
it’s not change when he offers four more years of bush economic policies that have failed to create well-paying jobs, or insure our workers, or help americans afford the skyrocketing cost of college, policies that have lowered the real incomes of the average american family, and widened the gap between wall street and main street, and left our children with a mountain of debt.
it’s not change when he promises to continue a policy in iraq that asks everything of our brave men and women in uniform and nothing of iraqi politicians, a policy where all we look for are reasons to stay in iraq, while we spend billions of dollars a month on a war that isn’t making the american people any safer.
so -- so, i’ll say this: there are many words to describe john mccain’s attempt to pass off his embrace of george bush
’s policies as bipartisan and new, but
“change” is not one of them.
“change” is not one of them, because change is a foreign policy that doesn’t begin and end with a war that should’ve never been authorized and never been waged.
i won’t stand here and pretend that there are many good options left in iraq, but what’s not an option is leaving our troops in that country for the next hundred years, especially at a time when our military is overstretched, our nation is isolated, and nearly every other threat to america is being ignored.
we
-- we must be -- we must be as careful getting out of iraq as we were careless getting in, but
we -- but start leaving we must.
it’s time for iraqis to take responsibility for their future.
it’s time to rebuild our military and give our veterans the care and the benefits they deserve when they come home.
it’s
time -- it's time to refocus our efforts on al qaida’s leadership and afghanistan, and rally the world against the common threats of the 21st century: terrorism and nuclear weapons, climate change and poverty, genocide and disease.
that’s what change is.
change -- change, minnesota, is realizing that meetings [sic] today’s threats requires not just our firepower, but the power of our diplomacy: tough -- tough, direct diplomacy, where the president of the united states isn’t afraid to let any petty dictator know where america stands and what we stand for.
we must once again have the courage and the conviction to lead the free world.
that is the legacy of roosevelt and truman and kennedy.
that’s what the american people demand.
that’s what change is.
change is building an economy that rewards not just wealth, but the work and the workers who created it.
it’s
understanding that the struggles facing working families can’t be solved by spending billions of dollars on more tax breaks for big corporations and wealthy ceos, but by giving a middle-class tax break to those who need it, and investing in our crumbling infrastructure, and transforming how we use energy, and improving our schools, and renewing our commitment to science and innovation.
it’s
understanding that fiscal responsibility and shared prosperity can go hand-in-hand, as they did when bill clinton was president.
john mccain has spent a lot of time talking about trips to iraq in the last few weeks, but maybe if he spent some time taking trips to the cities and towns that have been hardest hit by this economy -- cities in michigan, and ohio, and right here in minnesota -- he’d understand the kind of change that people are looking for.
maybe if he went to iowa and met the student who works the night shift after a full day of class and still can’t pay the medical bills for a sister who’s
ill
, he’d understand she can’t afford four more years of a health care plan that only takes care of the healthy and the wealthy.
she needs us to pass health care right now, a plan that guarantees insurance to every american who wants it and brings down premiums for every family who needs it.
that’s the change we need, minnesota.
maybe -- maybe if john mccain went to pennsylvania and he met the man who lost his job, but can’t even afford the gas to drive around and look for a new one
, he’d understand we can’t afford four more years of our addiction to oil from dictators.
that man needs us to pass an energy policy that works with automakers to raise fuel standards, and makes corporations pay for their pollution, and oil companies invest their record profits in a clean energy future, an energy policy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and can’t be outsourced.
that’s the change we need, minnesota.
and maybe if john mccain spent some time in the schools of south carolina or st. paul, minnesota, or where he spoke tonight in new orleans, louisiana
, he’d understand that we can’t afford to leave the money behind for no child left behind; that we owe it to our children to invest in early-childhood education; and recruit an army of new teachers and give them better pay and more support; and finally decide that, in this global economy, the chance to get a college education should not be a privilege for the few, but a birthright of every american.
that’s the change we need in america.
that’s why i’m running for president of the united states.
now -- now, the other side will come here in september and offer a very different set of policies and positions, and that is a good thing.
that is a debate i look forward to.
it is a debate that the american people deserve on the issues that will help determine the future of this country and the future for our children.
but what you don’t deserve is another election that’s governed by fear, and innuendo, and division.
what you won’t hear from this campaign or this party is the kind of politics that uses religion as a wedge and patriotism as a bludgeon.
what you won’t see from this campaign or this party is a politics that sees our opponents not as competitors to challenge, but enemies to polarize, because we may call ourselves democrats and republicans, but we are americans first.
we are always americans first.
despite -- despite what the good senator from arizona may have said tonight, i’ve seen people of differing views and opinions find common cause
many times during my two decades in public life, and i’ve brought many together myself.
i’ve
walked arm-in-arm with community leaders on the south side of chicago and watched tensions fade as black and white and latino fought together for good jobs and good schools.
i’ve sat across the table from law enforcement officials and civil rights advocates to reform a criminal justice system that sent 13 innocent people to death row.
i’ve worked with friends in the other party to provide more children with health insurance and more working families with a tax break, to curb the spread of nuclear weapons and ensure that the american people know where their tax dollars are being spent, and to reduce the influence of lobbyists who have all too often set the agenda in washington.
in our country -- in our country, i have found that this cooperation happens not because we agree on everything, but because, behind all the false labels and false divisions and categories that define us, beyond all the petty bickering and point-scoring in washington, americans are a decent, generous, compassionate people, united by common challenges and common hopes.
and every so often, there are moments which call on that fundamental goodness to make this country great again.
so it was for that band of patriots who declared in a philadelphia hall the formation of a more perfect union, and for all those who gave on the fields of gettysburg and antietam their last full measure of devotion to save that same union.
so it was for the greatest generation that conquered fear itself, and liberated a continent from tyranny, and made this country home to untold opportunity and prosperity.
so it was for the workers who stood out on the picket lines,
the women who shattered glass ceilings, the children who braved a selma bridge for freedom’s cause.
so it has been for every generation that faced down the greatest challenges and the most improbable odds to leave their children a world that’s better and kinder and more just.
and so it must be for us.
america, this is our moment.
this is our time, our time to turn the page on the policies of the past, our time to bring new energy and new ideas to the challenges we face, our time to offer a new direction for this country that we love.
the journey will be difficult.
the road will be long.
i face this challenge -- i face this challenge with profound humility and knowledge of my own limitations, but i also face it with limitless faith in the capacity of the american people.
because if we are willing to work for it, and fight for it, and believe in it, then i am absolutely certain that, generations from now, we will be able to look back and tell our children that this was the moment when we began to provide care for the sick and good jobs to the jobless.
this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal.
this was the moment when we ended a war, and secured our nation, and restored our image as the last, best hope on earth.
this was the moment, this was the time when we came together to remake this great nation so that it may always reflect our very best selves and our highest ideals.
thank you, minnesota.
god bless you.
god bless the united states of america.
thank you so much.
thank you.
thank you.
thank you so much.
thank you.
thank you.
let me begin by thanking harris wofford for his contributions to this country.
in so many different ways, he exemplifies what we mean by the word "citizen."
and so we are very grateful to him for all the work he has done; and i'm thankful for the gracious and thoughtful introduction.
"we the people, in order to form a more perfect union."
two hundred and twenty one years ago, in a hall that still stands across the street, a group of men gathered and, with these simple words, launched america's improbable experiment in democracy.
farmers and scholars, statesmen and patriots who had traveled across the ocean to escape tyranny and persecution finally made real their declaration of independence at a philadelphia convention that lasted through the spring of 1787.
the document they produced was eventually signed, but ultimately unfinished.
it was stained by this nation's original sin of slavery, a question that divided the colonies and brought the convention to a stalemate until the founders chose to allow the slave trade to continue for at least 20 more years, and to leave any final resolution to future generations.
of course, the answer to the slavery question was already embedded within our constitution -- a constitution that had at is very core the ideal of equal citizenship under the law; a constitution that promised its people liberty and justice, and a union that could be and should be perfected over time.
and yet words on a parchment would not be enough to deliver slaves from bondage, or provide men and women of every color and creed their full rights and obligations as citizens of the united states.
what would be needed were americans in successive generations who were willing to do their part -- through protests and struggles, on the streets and in the courts, through a civil war and civil disobedience, and always at great risk -- to narrow that gap between the promise of our ideals and the reality of their time.
this was one of the tasks we set forth at the beginning of this presidential campaign: to continue the long march of those who came before us, a march for a more just, more equal, more free, more caring, and more prosperous america.
i chose to run for president at this moment in history because i believe deeply that we cannot solve the challenges of our time unless we solve them together, unless we perfect our union by understanding that we may have different stories, but we hold common hopes; that we may not look the same and may not have come from the same place, but we all want to move in the same direction: towards a better future for our children and our grandchildren.
and this belief comes from my unyielding faith in the decency and generosity of the american people.
but it also comes from my own story.
i'm the son of a black man from kenya and a white woman from kansas.
i was raised with the help of a white grandfather who survived a depression to serve in patton's army during world war ii, and a white grandmother who worked on a bomber assembly line at fort leavenworth while he was overseas.
i've gone to some of the best schools in america
and i've lived in one of the world's poorest nations.
i am married to a black american who carries within her the blood of slaves and slave owners, an inheritance we pass on to our two precious daughters.
i have brothers, sisters, nieces, nephews, uncles, and cousins of every race and every hue scattered across three continents.
and for as long as i live, i will never forget that in no other country on earth is my story even possible.
it's a story that hasn't made me the most conventional of candidates.
but it is a story that has seared into my genetic makeup the idea that this nation is more than the sum of its parts -- that out of many, we are truly one.
now throughout the first year of this campaign, against all predictions to the contrary, we saw how hungry the american people were for this message of unity.
despite the temptation to view my candidacy through a purely racial lens, we won commanding victories in states with some of the whitest populations in the country.
in south carolina, where the confederate flag still flies, we built a powerful coalition of african americans and white americans.
this is not to say that race has not been an issue in this campaign.
at various stages in the campaign, some commentators have deemed me either "too black" or "not black enough.
" we saw racial tensions bubble to the surface during the week before the south carolina primary.
the press has scoured every single exit poll for the latest evidence of racial polarization, not just in terms of white and black, but black and brown as well.
and yet, it's only been in the last couple of weeks that the discussion of race in this campaign has taken a particularly divisive turn.
on one end of the spectrum, we've heard the implication that my candidacy is somehow an exercise in affirmative action; that it's based solely on the desire of wild and wide-eyed liberals to purchase racial reconciliation on the cheap.
on the other end, we've heard my former pastor, jeremiah wright, use incendiary language to express views that have the potential not only to widen the racial divide, but views that denigrate both the greatness and the goodness of our nation and that rightly offend white and black alike.
now i've already condemned, in unequivocal terms, the statements of reverend wright that have caused such controversy, and in some cases, pain.
for some, nagging questions remain:
did i know him to be an occasionally fierce critic of american domestic and foreign policy?
of course.
did i ever hear him make remarks that could be considered controversial while i sat in the church?
yes.
did i strongly disagree with many of his political views?
absolutely, just as i'm sure many of you have heard remarks from your pastors, priests, or rabbis with which you strongly disagree.
but the remarks that have caused this recent firestorm weren't simply controversial.
they weren't simply a religious leader's efforts to speak out against perceived injustice.
instead, they expressed a profoundly distorted view of this country, a view that sees white racism as endemic and that elevates what is wrong with america above all that we know is right with america; a view that sees the conflicts in the middle east as rooted primarily in the actions of stalwart allies like israel instead of emanating from the perverse and hateful ideologies of radical islam.
as such, reverend wright's comments were not only wrong but divisive, divisive at a time when we need unity; racially charged at a time when we need to come together to solve a set of monumental problems: two wars, a terrorist threat, a falling economy, a chronic health care crisis, and potentially devastating climate change -- problems that are neither black or white or latino or asian, but rather problems that confront us all.
given my background, my politics, and my professed values and ideals, there will no doubt be those for whom my statements of condemnation are not enough.
why associate myself with reverend wright in the first place, they may ask?
why not join another church?
and i confess that if all that i knew of reverend wright were the snippets of those sermons that have run in an endless loop on the television sets and youtube, if trinity united church of christ conformed to the caricatures being peddled by some commentators, there is no doubt that i would react in much the same way.
but the truth is, that isn't all that i know of the man.
the man i met more than twenty years ago is a man who helped introduce me to my christian faith, a man who spoke to me about our obligations to love one another, to care for the sick and lift up the poor.
he is a man who served his country as a united states marine, and who has studied and lectured at some of the finest universities and seminaries in the country, and who over 30 years has led a church that serves the community by doing god's work here on earth -- by housing the homeless, ministering to the needy, providing day care services and scholarships and prison ministries, and reaching out to those suffering from hiv/aids.
in my first book, dreams from my father, i described the experience of my first service at trinity, and it goes as follows:
people began to shout, to rise from their seats and clap and cry out, a forceful wind carrying the reverend's voice up to the rafters.
and in that single note -- hope --
i heard something else; at the foot of that cross, inside the thousands of churches across the city, i imagined the stories of ordinary black people merging with the stories of david and goliath, moses and pharaoh, the christians in the lion's den, ezekiel's field of dry bones.
those stories of survival and freedom and hope became our stories, my story.
the blood that spilled was our blood; the tears our tears; until this black church, on this bright day, seemed once more a vessel carrying the story of a people into future generations and into a larger world.
our trials and triumphs became at once unique and universal, black and more than black.
in chronicling our journey, the stories and songs gave us a meaning to reclaim memories that we didn't need to feel shame about -- memories that all people might study and cherish and with which we could start to rebuild.
that has been my experience at trinity.
like other predominantly black churches across the country, trinity embodies the black community in its entirety -- the doctor and the welfare mom, the model student and the former gang-banger.
like other black churches, trinity's services are full of raucous laughter and sometimes bawdy humor.
they are full of dancing and clapping and screaming and shouting that may seem jarring to the untrained ear.
the church contains in full the kindness and cruelty, the fierce intelligence and the shocking ignorance, the struggles and successes, the love and,
yes, the bitterness and biases that make up the black experience in america.
and this helps explain, perhaps, my relationship with reverend wright.
as imperfect as he may be, he has been like family to me.
he strengthens my faith, officiated my wedding, and baptized my children.
not once in my conversations with him have i heard him talk about any ethnic group in derogatory terms or treat whites with whom he interacted with anything but courtesy and respect.
he contains within him the contradictions -- the good and the bad -- of the community that he has served diligently for so many years.
i can no more disown him than i can disown the black community.
i can no more disown him than i can disown my white grandmother, a woman who helped raise me, a woman who sacrificed again and again for me, a woman who loves me as much as she loves anything in this world, but a woman who once confessed her fear of black men who passed her by on the street, and who on more than one occasion has uttered racial or ethnic stereotypes that made me cringe.
these people are part of me.
and they are part of america, this country that i love.
now, some will see this as an attempt to justify or excuse comments that are simply inexcusable.
i can assure you it is not.
and i suppose the politically safe thing to do would be to move on from this episode and just hope that it fades into the woodwork.
we can dismiss reverend wright as a crank or a demagogue, just as some have dismissed geraldine ferraro in the aftermath of her recent statements as harboring some deep -- deep-seated bias.
but race is an issue that i believe this nation cannot afford to ignore right now.
we would be making the same mistake that reverend wright made in his offending sermons about america: to simplify and stereotype and amplify the negative to the point that it distorts reality.
the fact is that the comments that have been made and the issues that have surfaced over the last few weeks reflect the complexities of race in this country that we've never really worked through, a part of our union that we have not yet made perfect.
and if we walk away now, if we simply retreat into our respective corners, we will never be able to come together and solve challenges like health care or education or the need to find good jobs for every american.
understanding --
understanding this reality requires a reminder of how we arrived at this point.
as william faulkner once wrote, "the past isn't dead and buried.
in fact, it isn't even past.
" we do not need to recite here the history of racial injustice in this country.
but we do need to remind ourselves that so many of the disparities that exist between the african-american community and the larger american community today can be traced directly to inequalities passed on from an earlier generation that suffered under the brutal legacy of slavery and jim crow.
segregated schools were, and are, inferior schools.
we still haven't fixed them, 50 years after brown versus board of education.
and the inferior education they provided, then and now, helps explain the pervasive achievement gap between today's black and white students.
legalized discrimination, where blacks were prevented, often through violence, from owning property, or loans were not granted to african-american business owners, or black homeowners could not access fha mortgages, or blacks were excluded from unions, or the police force, or the fire department meant that black families could not amass any meaningful wealth to bequeath to future generations.
that history helps explain the wealth and income gap between blacks and whites and the concentrated pockets of poverty that persist in so many of today's urban and rural communities.
a lack of economic opportunity among black men and the shame and frustration that came from not being able to provide for one's family contributed to the erosion of black families, a problem that welfare policies for many years may have worsened.
and the lack of basic services in so many urban black neighborhoods -- parks for kids to play in, police walking the beat, regular garbage pick-up, building code enforcement -- all helped create a cycle of violence, blight, and neglect that continues to haunt us.
this is the reality in which reverend wright and other african-americans of his generation grew up.
they came of age in the late '50s and early '60s, a time when segregation was still the law of the land and opportunity was systematically constricted.
what's remarkable is not how many failed in the face of discrimination, but how many men and women overcame the odds, how many were able to make a way out of no way for those like me who would come after them.
but for all those who scratched and clawed their way to get a piece of the american dream, there were many who didn't make it -- those who were ultimately defeated, in one way or another, by discrimination.
that legacy of defeat was passed on to future generations -- those young men and increasingly young women who we see standing on street corners or languishing in our prisons, without hope or prospects for the future.
even for those blacks who did make it, questions of race, and racism, continue to define their world view in fundamental ways.
for the men and women of reverend wright's generation, the memories of humiliation and doubt and fear have not gone away, nor has the anger and the bitterness of those years.
that anger may not get expressed in public, in front of white co-workers or white friends, but it does find voice in the barbershop or the beauty shop or around the kitchen table.
at times, that anger is exploited by politicians to gin up votes along racial lines or to make up for a politician's own failings.
and occasionally it finds voice in the church on sunday morning, in the pulpit and in the pews.
the fact that so many people are surprised to hear that anger in some of reverend wright's sermons simply reminds us of that old truism that the most segregated hour of american life occurs on sunday morning.
that -- that anger is not always productive.
indeed, all too often it distracts attention from solving real problems.
it keeps us from squarely facing our own complicity within the african-american community in our own condition.
it prevents the african-american community from forging the alliances it needs to bring about real change.
but the anger is real; it is powerful, and to simply wish it away, to condemn it without understanding its roots only serves to widen the chasm of misunderstanding that exists between the races.
in fact, a similar anger exists within segments of the white community.
most working and middle-class white americans don't feel that they've been particularly privileged by their race.
their experience is the immigrant experience.
as far as they're concerned, no one handed them anything; they built it from scratch.
they've worked hard all their lives, many times only to see their jobs shipped overseas or their pensions dumped after a lifetime of labor.
they are anxious about their futures, and they feel their dreams slipping away.
and in an era of stagnant wages and global competition, opportunity comes to be seen as a zero sum game, in which your dreams come at my expense.
so when they are told to bus their children to a school across town, when they hear that an african american is getting an advantage in landing a good job or a spot in a good college because of an injustice that they themselves never committed, when they're told that their fears about crime in urban neighborhoods are somehow prejudice, resentment builds over time.
like the anger within the black community, these resentments aren't always expressed in polite company.
but they have helped shape the political landscape for at least a generation.
anger over welfare and affirmative action helped forge the reagan coalition.
politicians routinely exploited fears of crime for their own electoral ends.
talk show hosts and conservative commentators built entire careers unmasking bogus claims of racism while dismissing legitimate discussions of racial injustice and inequality as mere political correctness or reverse racism.
and just as black anger often proved counterproductive, so have these white resentments distracted attention from the real culprits of the middle class squeeze: a corporate culture rife with inside dealing, questionable accounting practices, and short-term greed; a washington dominated by lobbyists and special interests; economic policies that favor the few over the many.
and yet, to wish away the resentments of white americans, to label them as misguided or even racist without recognizing they are grounded in legitimate concerns, this, too, widens the racial divide and blocks the path to understanding.
this is where we are right now.
it's a racial stalemate we've been stuck in for years.
and contrary to the claims of some of my critics, black and white, i have never been so naive as to believe that we can get beyond our racial divisions in a single election cycle or with a single candidate, particularly -- particularly a candidacy as imperfect as my own.
but i have asserted a firm conviction, a conviction rooted in my faith in god and my faith in the american people, that, working together, we can move beyond some of our old racial wounds and that, in fact, we have no choice -- we have no choice if we are to continue on the path of a more perfect union.
for the african-american community, that path means embracing the burdens of our past without becoming victims of our past.
it means continuing to insist on a full measure of justice in every aspect of american life.
but it also means binding our particular grievances, for better health care and better schools and better jobs, to the larger aspirations of all americans -- the white woman struggling to break the glass ceiling, the white man who's been laid off, the immigrant trying to feed his family.
and it means also taking full responsibility for our own lives -- by demanding more from our fathers, and spending more time with our children, and reading to them, and teaching them that while they may face challenges and discrimination in their own lives, they must never succumb to despair or cynicism.
they must always believe -- they must always believe that they can write their own destiny.
ironically, this quintessentially american -- and, yes, conservative -- notion of self-help found frequent expression in reverend wright's sermons.
but what my former pastor too often failed to understand is that embarking on a program of self-help also requires a belief that society can change.
the profound mistake of reverend wright's sermons is not that he spoke about racism in our society.
it's that he spoke as if our society was static, as if no progress had been made, as if this country -- a country that has made it possible for one of his own members to run for the highest office in the land and build a coalition of white and black, latino, asian, rich, poor, young and old -- is still irrevocably bound to a tragic past.
what we know, what we have seen, is that america can change.
that is true genius of this nation.
what we have already achieved gives us hope -- the audacity to hope -- for what we can and must achieve tomorrow.
now, in the white community, the path to a more perfect union means acknowledging that what ails the african-american community does not just exist in the minds of black people; that the legacy of discrimination -- and current incidents of discrimination, while less overt than in the past -- that these things are real and must be addressed.
not just with words, but with deeds -- by investing in our schools and our communities; by enforcing our civil rights laws and ensuring fairness in our criminal justice system; by providing this generation with ladders of opportunity that were unavailable for previous generations.
it requires all americans to realize that your dreams do not have to come at the expense of my dreams, that investing in the health, welfare, and education of black and brown and white children will ultimately help all of america prosper.
in the end, then, what is called for is nothing more and nothing less than what all the world's great religions demand: that we do unto others as we would have them do unto us.
let us be our brother's keeper, scripture tells us.
let us be our sister's keeper.
let us find that common stake we all have in one another, and let our politics reflect that spirit as well.
for we have a choice in this country.
we can accept a politics that breeds division and conflict and cynicism.
we can tackle race only as spectacle, as we did in the o.j. trial; or in the wake of tragedy, as we did in the aftermath of katrina; or as fodder for the nightly news.
we can play reverend wright's sermons on every channel every day and talk about them from now until the election, and make the only question in this campaign whether or not the american people think that i somehow believe or sympathize with his most offensive words.
we can pounce on some gaffe by a hillary supporter as evidence that she's playing the race card; or we can speculate on whether white men will all flock to john mccain in the general election regardless of his policies.
we can do that.
but if we do, i can tell you that in the next election, we'll be talking about some other distraction, and then another one, and then another one.
and nothing will change.
that is one option.
or, at this moment, in this election, we can come together and say, "not this time.
" this time we want to talk about the crumbling schools that are stealing the future of black children and white children and asian children and hispanic children and native-american children.
this time we want to reject the cynicism that tells us that these kids can't learn; that those kids who don't look like us are somebody else's problem.
the children of america are not "those kids," -- they are our kids, and we will not let them fall behind in a 21st-century economy.
not this time.
this time we want to talk about how the lines in the emergency room are filled with whites and blacks and hispanics who do not have health care, who don't have the power on their own to overcome the special interests in washington, but who can take them on if we do it together.
this time we want to talk about the shuttered mills that once provided a decent life for men and women of every race, and the homes for sale that once belonged to americans from every religion, every region, every walk of life.
this time we want to talk about the fact that the real problem is not that someone who doesn't look like you might take your job; it's that the corporation you work for will ship it overseas for nothing more than a profit.
this time -- this time we want to talk about the men and women of every color and creed who serve together, and fight together, and bleed together under the same proud flag.
we want to talk about how to bring them home from a war that should've never been authorized and should've never been waged.
and we want to talk about how we'll show our patriotism by caring for them, and their families, and giving them the benefits that they have earned.
i would not be running for president if i didn't believe with all my heart that this is what the vast majority of americans want for this country.
this union may never be perfect, but generation after generation has shown that it can always be perfected.
and today, whenever i find myself feeling doubtful or cynical about this possibility, what gives me the most hope is the next generation -- the young people whose attitudes and beliefs and openness to change have already made history in this election.
there's one story in particular that i'd like to leave you with today, a story i told when i had the great honor of speaking on dr. king's birthday at his home church, ebenezer baptist, in atlanta.
there's a young, 23-year-old woman, a white woman named ashley baia, who organized for our campaign in florence, south carolina.
she'd been working to organize a mostly african-american community since the beginning of this campaign, and one day she was at a roundtable discussion where everyone went around telling their story and why they were there.
and ashley said that when she was 9 years old, her mother got cancer.
and because she had to miss days of work, she was let go and lost her health care.
they had to file for bankruptcy, and that's when ashley decided that she had to do something to help her mom.
she knew that food was one of their most expensive costs, and so ashley convinced her mother that what she really liked and really wanted to eat more than anything else was mustard and relish sandwiches -- because that was the cheapest way to eat.
that's the mind of a 9 year old.
she did this for a year until her mom got better.
and so ashley told everyone at the roundtable that the reason she had joined our campaign was so that she could help the millions of other children in the country who want and need to help their parents too.
now, ashley might have made a different choice.
perhaps somebody told her along the way that the source of her mother's problems were blacks who were on welfare and too lazy to work, or hispanics who were coming into the country illegally.
but she didn't.
she sought out allies in her fight against injustice.
anyway, ashley finishes her story and then goes around the room and asks everyone else why they're supporting the campaign.
they all have different stories and different reasons.
many bring up a specific issue.
and finally they come to this elderly black man who's been sitting there quietly the entire time.
and ashley asks him why he's there.
and he doesn't bring up a specific issue.
he does not say health care or the economy.
he does not say education or the war.
he does not say that he was there because of barack obama.
he simply says to everyone in the room, "i am here because of ashley."
"i'm here because of ashley."
now, by itself, that single moment of recognition between that young white girl and that old black man is not enough.
it is not enough to give health care to the sick, or jobs to the jobless, or education to our children.
but it is where we start.
it is where our union grows stronger.
and as so many generations have come to realize over the course of the 221 years since a band of patriots signed that document right here in philadelphia, that is where perfection begins.
thank you very much, everyone.
thank you.
thank you, south carolina.
thank you to the rock of my life, michelle obama.
thank you to malia and sasha obama, who haven't seen their daddy in a week.
thank you to pete skidmore for his outstanding service to our country and being such a great supporter of this campaign.
you know, over two weeks ago we saw the people of iowa proclaim that our time for change has come.
but there were those who doubted this country's desire for something new, who said iowa was a fluke, not to be repeated again.
well, tonight the cynics who believed that what began in the snows of iowa was just an illusion were told a different story by the good people of south carolina.
after four great contests in every corner of this country, we have the most votes, the most delegates -- and the most diverse coalition of americans that we've seen in a long, long time.
you can see it in the faces here tonight.
there are young and old, rich and poor.
they are black and white, latino and asian and native american.
they are democrats from des moines and independents from concord
and, yes, some republicans from rural nevada.
and we've got young people all across this country who've never had a reason to participate until now.
and in nine days, in nine short days, nearly half the nation will have the chance to join us in saying that we are tired of business as usual in washington.
we are hungry for change, and we are ready to believe again.
but if there's anything, though, that we've been reminded of since iowa
, it's that the kind of change we seek will not come easy.
now, partly because we have fine candidates in this field, fierce competitors who are worthy of our respect and our admiration -- and as contentious as this campaign may get, we have to remember that this is a contest for the democratic nomination and that all of us share an abiding desire to end the disastrous policies of the current administration.
but there are real differences between the candidates.
we are looking for more than just a change of party in the white house.
we're looking to fundamentally change the status quo in washington.
it's a status quo that extends beyond any particular party.
and right now that status quo is fighting back with everything it's got, with the same old tactics that divide and distract us from solving the problems people face, whether those problems are health care that folks can't afford or a mortgage they cannot pay.
so this will not be easy.
make no mistake about what we're up against.
we're up against the belief that it's all right for lobbyists to dominate our government, that they are just part of the system in washington.
but we know that the undue influence of lobbyists is part of the problem, and this election is our chance to say that we are not going to let them stand in our way anymore.
we're up against the conventional thinking that says your ability to lead as president comes from longevity in washington or proximity to the white house.
but we know that real leadership is about candor and judgment and the ability to rally americans from all walks of life around a common purpose, a higher purpose.
we're up against decades of bitter partisanship that cause politicians to demonize their opponents instead of coming together to make college affordable or energy cleaner.
it's the kind of partisanship where you're not even allowed to say that a republican had an idea, even if it's one you never agreed with.
that's the kind of politics that is bad for our party.
it is bad for our country.
and this is our chance to end it once and for all.
we're up against the idea that it's acceptable to say anything and do anything to win an election.
but we know that this is exactly what's wrong with our politics.
this is why people don't believe what their leaders say anymore.
this is why they tune out.
and this election is our chance to give the american people a reason to believe again.
but let me say this, south carolina.
what we've seen in these last weeks is that we're also up against forces that are not the fault of any one campaign but feed the habits that prevent us from being who we want to be as a nation.
it's a politics that uses religion as a wedge and patriotism as a bludgeon, a politics that tells us that we have to think, act, and even vote within the confines of the categories that supposedly define us, the assumption that young people are apathetic, the assumption that republicans won't cross over, the assumption that the wealthy care nothing for the poor and that the poor don't vote, the assumption that african-americans can't support the white candidate
, whites can't support the african-american candidate, blacks and latinos cannot come together.
we are here tonight to say that that is not the america we believe in.
i did not travel around this state over the last year and see a white south carolina or a black south carolina.
i saw south carolina -- because in the end, we're not up just against the ingrained and destructive habits of washington.
we're also struggling with our own doubts, our own fears, our own cynicism.
the change we seek has always required great struggle and great sacrifice.
and so this is a battle in our own hearts and minds about what kind of country we want and how hard we're willing to work for it.
so let me remind you tonight that change will not be easy.
change will take time.
there will be setbacks and false starts, and sometimes we'll make mistakes.
but as hard as it may seem, we cannot lose hope, because there are people all across this great nation who are counting on us, who can't afford another four years without health care.
they can't afford another four years without good schools.
they can't afford another four years without decent wages because our leaders couldn't come together and get it done.
theirs are the stories and voices we carry on from south carolina -- the mother who can't get medicaid to cover all the needs of her sick child.
she needs us to pass a health care plan that cuts costs and makes health care available and affordable for every single american.
that's what she's looking for.
the teacher who works another shift at dunkin' donuts after school just to make ends meet
-- she needs us to reform our education system so that she gets better pay and more support and that students get the resources that they need to achieve their dreams.
the maytag worker who's now competing with his own teenager for a $7-an-hour job at the local wal-mart because the factory he gave his life to shut its doors -- he needs us to stop giving tax breaks to companies that ship our jobs overseas and start putting them in the pockets of working americans who deserve it -- and put them in the pockets of struggling homeowners who are having a tough time, and looking after seniors who should retire with dignity and respect.
that woman who told me that she hasn't been able to breathe since the day her nephew left for iraq, or the soldier who doesn't know his child because he's on his third or fourth or even fifth tour of duty -- they need us to come together and put an end to a war that should have never been authorized and should have never been waged.
so understand this, south carolina.
the choice in this election is not between regions or religions or genders.
it's not about rich versus poor, young versus old, and it is not about black versus white.
this election is about the past versus the future.
it's about whether we settle for the same divisions and distractions and drama that passes for politics today or whether we reach for a politics of common sense and innovation, a politics of shared sacrifice and shared prosperity.
there are those who will continue to tell us that we can't do this, that we can't have what we're looking for, that we can't have what we want, that we're peddling false hopes.
but here's what i know.
i know that when people say we can't overcome all the big money and influence in washington, i think of that elderly woman who sent me a contribution the other day, an envelope that had a money order for $3.01 -- along with a verse of scripture tucked inside the envelope.
so don't tell us change isn't possible.
that woman knows change is possible.
when i hear the cynical talk that blacks and whites and latinos can't join together and work together, i'm reminded of the latino brothers and sisters
i organized with and stood with and fought with side by side for jobs and justice on the streets of chicago.
so don't tell us change can't happen.
when i hear that we'll never overcome the racial divide in our politics, i think about that republican woman who used to work for strom thurmond, who's now devoted to educating inner-city children, and who went out into the streets of south carolina and knocked on doors for this campaign.
don't tell me we can't change.
yes, we can.
yes, we can change.
yes, we can.
yes, we can heal this nation.
yes, we can seize our future.
and as we leave this great state with a new wind at our backs, and we take this journey across this great country, a country we love, with the message we've carried from the plains of iowa to the hills of new hampshire, from the nevada desert to the south carolina coast, the same message we had when we were up and when we were down, that out of many we are one, that while we breathe we will hope, and where we are met with cynicism and doubt and fear and those who tell us that we can't, we will respond with that timeless creed that sums up the spirit of the american people in three simple words:
yes, we can.
thank you, south carolina.
i love you.
scripture tells us that when joshua and the israelites arrived at the gates of jericho, they could not enter.
the walls of the city were too steep for any one person to climb.
they were too strong to be taken down by brute force.
and so, the people sat for days, unable to pass on through; but god had a plan for his people.
he told them to stand together and march together around the city, and on the seventh day he told them that when they heard the sound of the ram’s horn, they should speak with one voice.
and, at the chosen hour when the horn sounded and a chorus of voices cried out together, the mighty walls of jericho came tumbling down.
that’s what scripture tells us.
and there are many lessons to take from this passage, just as there are many lessons to take from this day, just as there are many memories that fill the space of this church.
as i was thinking about which ones we needed to remember at this hour, my mind went back to the very beginning of the modern civil rights era.
because before memphis and the mountaintop, before the bridge in selma and the march on washington, before birmingham and the beatings, the fire hoses, and the loss of those four little girls, before there was king the icon and his magnificent dream, there was king the young preacher and a people who found themselves suffering under the yolk of oppression.
and on the eve of the bus boycotts in montgomery, at a time when many were still doubtful about the possibilities of change, a time when there were those in the black community who not only mistrusted each other, but mistrusted themselves -- king inspired with words not of anger, but of an urgency, a fierce urgency that still speaks to us today.
“unity,” he said, “is the great need of the hour.”
“unity is the great need of the hour.”
unity is how we shall overcome.
what dr. king understood is that if just one person chose to walk instead of ri[de] the bus, those walls of oppression would not be moved.
but maybe if a few more decided to walk, those foundations might start to shake.
if just a few women were willing to do what rosa parks had been willing to do, maybe the cracks in those walls would start to show.
if teenagers took rides from north to south, maybe a few bricks would come loose.
maybe if white folks marched because they’d come to understand that their freedom was wrapped up in the freedom of others, that they too had a stake in the impending battle, the walls would begin to sway, and if enough americans were awakened to injustice, if they joined together north and south, rich and poor, jew and gentile, then perhaps that wall would come tumbling down, and justice would flow like waters of righteousness, like a mighty stream.
“unity is the great need of the hour.”
that’s what dr. king said.
it is the great need of this hour as well, not because it sounds pleasant, not because it makes us feel good, but because it's the only way we can overcome the essential deficit that exits in this country.
i’m not talking about the budget deficit.
i’m not talking about the trade deficit.
talking about the moral deficit in this country.
i’m talking about an empathy deficit, the inability to recognize ourselves in one another, to understand that we are our brother’s keeper and our sister’s keeper, that in the words of dr. king, “we are all tied together in a single garment of destiny.”
we have an empathy deficit when we’re still sending our children down corridors of shame, schools in the forgotten corners of america where the color of your skin still affects the content of your education.
we have a deficit when ceos are making more in ten minutes than ordinary workers are making in an entire year, when families lose their homes so unscrupulous lenders can make a profit, when mothers can’t afford a doctor when their children are stricken with illness.
we have a deficit in this country when we have scooter libby justice for some and jena justice for others, when our children see hanging nooses from a school yard tree today, in the present, in the 21st century.
we have a deficit when homeless veterans sleep on the streets of our cities, when innocents are slaughtered in the deserts of darfur, when young americans serve tour after tour after tour after tour of duty in a war that should have never been authorized and should have never been waged.
we have an empathy deficit in this country that has to be closed.
we have a deficit when it takes a breach in the levees to reveal the breach in our compassion, when it takes a terrible storm to reveal the hungry that god calls on us to feed, the sick that he calls on us to care for, the least of these that he commands that we treat as our own.
so, we have a deficit to close.
we have walls, barriers to justice and equality that must come down, and to do this, we know that “unity is the great need of the hour.”
however, all too often, when we talk about unity in this country, we’ve come to believe that it can be purchased on the cheap.
we’ve come to believe that racial reconciliation can come easily; that it’s just a matter of a few ignorant people trapped in the prejudices of the past, and that if the demagogues and those who would exploit our racial divisions will simply go away then all our problems will be solved.
all too often, we seek to ignore the profound structural and institutional barriers that stand in the way of insuring opportunity for all of our children, or decent jobs for all of our people, or health care for those who are sick.
we offer unity, but we are not willing to pay the price that's required 

of course, true unity cannot be so easily purchased.
it starts with a change in attitudes.
it starts with changing our hearts, and changing our minds, broadening our spirit.
it’s not easy to stand in somebody else’s shoes.
it’s not easy to see past our own differences.
we’ve all encountered this in our own lives.
what makes it even more difficult is that we have a politics in this country that seeks to drive us apart, that puts up walls between us.
we are told that those who differ from us on a few things, differ from us on all things, that our problems are the fault of those who don’t think like us or look like us or come from where we do.
the welfare queen, she’s taking our money.
the immigrant, he’s taking our jobs.
the believer condemns the nonbeliever as immoral, and the nonbeliever chides the believer for being intolerant.
and for most of this country’s history, we in the african-american community have been at the receiving end of man’s inhumanity to man.
and all of us understand insidious -- all of us understand intimately the insidious role that race still sometimes plays on the job and in the schools, in our health care system, and in our criminal justice system.
and yet, if we are honest with ourselves, we must admit that none of our hands are entirely clean.
if we’re honest with ourselves, we'll acknowledge that our own community has not always been true to king’s vision of a beloved community.
if we’re honest with ourselves, we have to admit that there have been times when we've scorned our gay brothers and sisters instead of embracing them.
the scourge of anti-semitism has at times revealed itself in our community.
for too long, some of us have seen immigrants only as competitors for jobs instead of companions in the fight for opportunity.
everyday our politics fuels and exploits this kind of division across all races and regions, across gender and party.
it is played out on television; it is sensationalized by the media.
last week, it crept into the campaign for president with charges and countercharges that serve to obscure the issues instead of illuminating the critical choices we face as a nation.
none of our hands are clean.
so let us say that on this day of all days, each of us carries with us the task of changing our hearts and minds.
the divisions, the stereotypes, the scapegoating, the ease with which we blame the plight of ourselves on others -- all of that distracts us from the common challenges that we face, war and poverty, inequality and injustice.
we can no longer afford to build ourselves up by tearing each other down.
we can no longer afford to traffic in lies or fear or hate.
it's the poison that we must purge from our politics, the wall that we must tear down before the hour grows too late.
because if dr. king could love his jailer, if he could call on the faithful, who once sat where you do, to forgive those who had set dogs and fire hoses upon them, then surely we can look past what divides us in our time and bind up our wounds and erase the sympathy deficit that exists in our hearts.
but if changing our hearts and our minds is the first critical step, we cannot stop there.
it’s not enough to bemoan the plight of the poor in this country and remain unwilling to push our elected officials to provide the resources to fix our schools.
it's not enough to decry the disparities of health care and yet allow the insurance companies and the drug companies to block real reform in our health care system.
it’s not enough -- it’s not enough for us to abhor the costs of a misguided war, and yet we continue to allow ourselves to be driven by a politics of fear that sees the threat of an attack as a way to scare up votes instead of a call to come together in a common effort.
scripture tells us that we are judged not just by word but by deed.
and if we are truly to bring about the unity that is needed, that is so crucial in this time, we have to find it within ourselves to act on what we know, to understand that living up to this country’s ideals and its possibilities is going to require great effort and great resources, sacrifice and stamina.
we can’t pass a law called no child left behind and then leave the money behind.
that is not a serious effort in bringing about the unity that is needed.
we can’t celebrate dr. king’s dream, and yet still have insufficient funds to cash that promissory note that was promised at the beginning of this nation.
that is what is at stake in this great debate we are having today.
changes that are needed are not just a matter of tinkering around the edges.
they will not come if politicians simply tell us what we want to hear.
all of us will be called upon to make some sacrifice.
none of us will be exempt from responsibility.
we've had to fight to fix our schools, but we also have to challenge ourselves to be better parents, and turn off the television set, and put away the video game, and our men have to be home with our children.
that, too, is part of the challenge that we must make.
we will have to confront the biases in our criminal justice system, but we also have to acknowledge the deep-seeded violence that still resides in our own communities, in too many of the hearts of our young people, and we have to break the grip of that violence wherever we see it.
that’s how we’re going to bring about the change that we seek.
that’s how dr. king led this country through the wilderness.
he did it with words, words that he spoke not just to the children of slaves but the children of slave owners, words that inspired not just black but also white, not just christian but also jew and muslim and buddhists and atheists, not just the southerner but also the northerner.
he led with words, but he also led with deeds.
he also led by example.
he led by marching and going to jail and suffering threats and beatings and being away from his family.
he led by taking a stand against a war knowing full well that it would diminish his popularity.
he led by challenging our economic structures, understanding that it would cause discomfort.
dr. king understood that unity cannot be won on the cheap, that we would have to earn it through great effort and determination.
that’s the unity, the hard earned unity that we need right now.
that is the effort, the determination that can transform blind optimism into hope.
you know people have remarked on the fact that i talk about hope a lot in my campaign.
you know they -- they tease me a little bit.
some have been scornful.
they say, “ah, he’s talking about hope again.
he’s so idealistic.
he’s
so naïve.
he’s a hope monger.”
that
’s okay.
it’s true.
i talk about hope.
i talk about it a lot because the odds of me standing here today are so small, so remote that i couldn’t of gotten here without some hope.
you know my -- my daddy left me when i was two years old.
i needed some hope to get here.
i was raised by a single mother.
i needed some hope to get here.
i got in trouble when i was a teenager, did some things folks now like to talk about.
i needed some hope to get here.
i wasn’t born into money, or great wealth, or great privilege, or status.
i was given love, an education, and some hope.
that’s what i got.
that’s my birthright.
so i talk about hope.
i
-- i put “hope” on my campaign signs.
it doesn’t even have my name on them sometimes -- just says “hope.”
folks don’t know who they’re voting for, but it makes them feel good.
say, you know, huh?
i spoke about hope at the democratic convention.
i
-- i wrote a book called the audacity of hope.
and so i -- so i’m puzzled when -- when some people, some of the other candidates make a mockery of the idea.
they say i’m pedaling false hopes. "
get a reality check," they tell me.
and i have to --
i have to try to understand what they're saying.
the implication is is that if you are hopeful, that you somehow must be engaging in wishful thinking.
your -- your head must be in the clouds; that you must be passive and just sit back and wait for things to happen to you.
that seems to be the implication.
and so i have to explain to people that’s not what hope is.
hope is not blind optimism.
hope is not ignorance of the barriers and hurdles and hazards that stand in your way.
hope’s just the opposite.
i know how hard it will be to provide health care to every single american.
the insurance companies, drug companies, they don’t want to give up their profits.
i know it won’t be easy to have a energy policy that makes sense for america because the oil companies like writing the energy bills.
i know that alleviating poverty, or making sure all our children can learn, or eliminating the scourge of racism in our society -- none of those things lend themselves to simple solutions.
i know because i fought on the streets as a community organizer in poor neighborhoods on the southside of chicago alongside those without jobs or without prospects for the future.
i have fought in the courts as a civil rights attorney for those who had been denied opportunity on the job or denied access to the ballot box.
i’ve seen good legislation die because -- well, i’ve seen that too --
i’ve seen good legislation die because good intentions weren’t enough, because they weren’t fortified with a political majority and political will.
i’ve seen this country -- this country
’s judgment clouded by fear.
i know how easily a country can be misled when it is afraid.
i know how hard it is.
everybody here understands how difficult it is to bring about true change,
change that we can believe in.
but i also know this -- that nothing in this country worthwhile has ever happened except somebody somewhere decided to hope.
that’s how this country was founded because a group of patriots decided they were going to take on the british empire.
nobody was putting their money on them.
that’s how slaves and abolitionists resisted that evil system.
that’s how a new president was able to chart a course to insure that this nation would no longer remain half slave and half free.
that’s how the greatest generation defeated fascism and overcame a great depression.
that’s how women won the right to vote.
that’s how workers won the right to organize.
that’s how young people and old people and middle-aged folks were willing to walk instead of ride the bus, and folks came down on freedom rides.
they marched, and they sat in, and they were beaten and fire houses were sent on them, and dogs were sent on them, and some went to jail, and some died for freedom's cause.
that’s what hope is.
imagining and then fighting for and struggling for and sometimes dying for what didn’t seem possible before.
there’s nothing naïve about that.
there are no false hopes in that.
i don’t believe in false hopes.
imagine if john f. kennedy had looked up at the moon and said, "well, that’s too far."
false hopes, we can’t go there.
if dr. king had stood on the lincoln memorial and said, "y’all go home; we can’t overcome.
" there’s no such thing as false hopes, but what i know deep in my heart is that we cannot bring about change unless we are unified, unless we do it together.
change does not happen from the top down -- in america or anywhere else.
it happens from the bottom up.
it happens because ordinary people dream extraordinary things.
it’s because all of you decide that change must come.
that i know.
it wasn’t just one voice -- it wasn't just one voice that shouted out before the walls of jericho.
all the voices came together, a chorus of voices.
that’s what gives me hope: not just those who ascend to high office, but the changes that are happening in ordinary places.
the stories that give me my hope don’t happen in the spotlight.
when i think about dr. king, i suspect he was sustained not by having dinner with presidents; not by getting the nobel peace prize; but coming back to church and seeing the mothers of the church and the deacons.
those who maintained their dignity were standing up straight in the face of injustice.
that’s where he drew his hope.
he saw god in their faces.
those stories don’t happen on a presidential stage; they happen in the quiet quarters of our lives.
they happen in the moments we least expect.
so, let me close by giving an example of one of those stories.
there is a young woman, 23 years old, white woman, named ashley baia, who organizes for our campaign in florence, south carolina.
ashley has been working to organize mostly black folks.
she’s in florence, south carolina.
she’s been doing it since the beginning of the campaign, and the other day she...set up a round table discussion where everyone around was telling their story about who they were and why they were there.
and so, ashley explained, she started things off, by explaining why she was there.
and she explained that when she was nine years old her mother got cancer, and because she had to miss a day of work she was let go; and she lost her health care; and then she had to file for bankruptcy.
they were on hard times, and that’s when ashley, nine-years-old at the time, decided she had to do something to help her mom, and she knew that food was one of their most expensive costs.
they didn’t have a lot of money.
ashley lived in a poor household.
and so ashley convinced her mother that she really liked and really wanted to eat more than anything else mustard and relish sandwiches.
she had heard that condiments like mustard and relish were cheap.
and she -- she concocted in her own mind at the age of nine that she would convince her mother that that’s the only thing she wanted to eat everyday, because she figured that would be a way of saving money for the family and helping them alleviate their hardships.
so she did this for a year until her mom got better.
and in that round table she told everyone that the reason she joined our campaign was so that she could help millions of other children in the country who want and need to help their parents too.
she had heard me speak about my mother having cancer and having to worry about maybe not getting the health care she needed because of a preexisting condition, and she had connected with that.
she thought, maybe barack would fight for my mother.
and if he would fight for my mother, then maybe i will fight alongside him.
that’s what had brought her to florence.
so ashley finishes her story and then goes around the room and asks everyone else why they’re supporting the campaign.
they all have different stories and different reasons: some bring up specific issues; some talk about, upset about, affirmative action; some talk about, you know, "i want to see more jobs in the community"; some are frustrated about trade; some just like me.
so they all got a bunch of different reasons, and finally, at the end of this discussion, they come to this elderly black man.
he’s been sitting there quiet the whole time, hasn’t been saying a word.
and ashley asks him why is he there.
and he doesn’t bring up a specific issue.
he does not say healthcare or the economy.
he doesn’t talk about the iraq war.
he doesn’t say anything about education.
he doesn’t say that he’s there because he likes barack obama, or he’s proud of the possibility of the first african american president.
he simply says to everyone in the room, “i am here because of ashley.
i am here because of this young girl, and the fact that she's willing to fight for what she believes in.
and that reminds me that i still have some fight left in me, and
i’m going stand up for what i believe in.”
now, by itself, that single moment of recognition between that young white girl and that old black man, that’s not enough to change a country.
by itself, it’s not enough to give health care to the sick or jobs to the jobless or education to our children, but it is where we begin.
it’s why i believe that the walls in that room began to shake at that moment.
and if they can shake in that room, then they can shake here in atlanta, and if they can shake in atlanta, then they can shake in the state of georgia, and if they can shake in georgia, they can shake all across america.
and if enough of our voices join together, if we see each other in each other’s
eyes, we can bring those walls tumbling down.
the walls of jericho can finally come tumbling down.
that is our hope, but only if we pray together, if we work together, and if we march together.
ebenezer, we cannot walk alone.
brothers and sisters, we cannot walk alone.
in the struggle for justice and for equality, we cannot walk alone.
in the struggle for opportunity and justice, we cannot walk alone.
in the struggle to heal this nation and repair the world, we cannot walk alone.
so i ask you to walk with me and march with me and join your voices with mine, and together we will sing the song that tears down the walls that divide us and lift up an america that is truly indivisible with liberty and justice for all.
may god bless the memory of the great pastor of this church.
and may god bless the united states of america.
thank you.
thank you.
thank you.
thank you, new hampshire.
i love you back.
thank you.
thank you.
well, thank you so much.
i am still fired up and ready to go.
thank you.
thank you.
well, first of all, i want to congratulate senator clinton on a hard-fought victory here in new hampshire.
she did an outstanding job.
give her a big round of applause.
you know, a few weeks ago, no one imagined that we'd have accomplished what we did here tonight in new hampshire.
no one could have imagined it.
for most of this campaign, we were far behind.
we always knew our climb would be steep.
but in record numbers, you came out, and you spoke up for change.
and with your voices and your votes, you made it clear that at this moment, in this election, there is something happening in america.
there is something happening when men and women in des moines and davenport, in lebanon and concord, come out in the snows of january to wait in lines that stretch block after block because they believe in what this country can be.
there is something happening.
there's something happening when americans who are young in age and in spirit, who've never participated in politics before, turn out in numbers we have never seen because they know in their hearts that this time must be different.
there's something happening when people vote not just for party that they belong to, but the hopes that they hold in common.
and whether we are rich or poor, black or white, latino or asian, whether we hail from iowa or new hampshire, nevada or south carolina, we are ready to take this country in a fundamentally new direction.
that's what's happening in america right now; change is what's happening in america.
you, all of you who are here tonight, all who put so much heart and soul and work into this campaign, you can be the new majority who can lead this nation out of a long political darkness.
democrats, independents and republicans who are tired of the division and distraction that has clouded washington, who know that we can disagree without being disagreeable, who understand that, if we mobilize our voices to challenge the money and influence that stood in our way and challenge ourselves to reach for something better, there is no problem we cannot solve, there is no destiny that we cannot fulfill.
our new american majority can end the outrage of unaffordable, unavailable health care in our time.
we can bring doctors and patients, workers and businesses, democrats and republicans together, and we can tell the drug and insurance industry that, while they get a seat at the table, they don't get to buy every chair, not this time, not now.
our new majority can end the tax breaks for corporations that ship our jobs overseas and put a middle-class tax cut in the pockets of working americans who deserve it.
we can stop sending our children to schools with corridors of shame and start putting them on a pathway to success.
we can stop talking about how great teachers are and start rewarding them for their greatness by giving them more pay and more support.
we can do this with our new majority.
we can harness the ingenuity of farmers and scientists, citizens and entrepreneurs to free this nation from the tyranny of oil and save our planet from a point of no return.
and when i am president of the united states, we will end this war in iraq and bring our troops home.
we will end this war in iraq.
we will bring our troops home.
we will finish the job -- we will finish the job against al qaida in afghanistan.
we will care for our veterans.
we will restore our moral standing in the world.
and we will never use 9/11 as a way to scare up votes, because it is not a tactic to win an election.
it is a challenge that should unite america and the world against the common threats of the 21st century: terrorism and nuclear weapons, climate change and poverty, genocide and disease.
all of the candidates in this race share these goals.
all of the candidates in this race have good ideas and all are patriots who serve this country honorably.
but the reason our campaign has always been different, the reason we began this improbable journey almost a year ago is because it's not just about what i will do as president.
it is also about what you, the people who love this country, the citizens of the united states of america, can do to change it.
that's what this election is all about.
that's why tonight belongs to you.
it belongs to the organizers, and the volunteers, and the staff who believed in this journey and rallied so many others to join the cause.
we know the battle ahead will be long.
but always remember that, no matter what obstacles stand in our way, nothing can stand in the way of the power of millions of voices calling for change.
we have been told we cannot do this by a chorus of cynics.
and they will only grow louder and more dissonant in the weeks and months to come.
we've been asked to pause for a reality check.
we've been warned against offering the people of this nation false hope.
but in the unlikely story that is america, there has never been anything false about hope.
for when we have faced down impossible odds, when we've been told we're not ready or that we shouldn't try or that we can't, generations of americans have responded with a simple creed that sums up the spirit of a people:
yes we can.
yes we can.
yes we can.
it was a creed written into the founding documents that declared the destiny of a nation:
yes, we can.
it was whispered by slaves and abolitionists as they blazed a trail towards freedom through the darkest of nights: yes, we can.
it was sung by immigrants as they struck out from distant shores and pioneers who pushed westward against an unforgiving wilderness
: yes, we can.
it was the call of workers who organized, women who reached for the ballot, a president who chose the moon as our new frontier, and a king who took us to the mountaintop and pointed the way to the promised land:
yes, we can, to justice and equality.
yes we can -- to opportunity and prosperity.
yes we can heal this nation.
yes we can repair this world.
yes we can.
and so, tomorrow, as we take the campaign south and west, as we learn that the struggles of the textile workers in spartanburg are not so different than the plight of the dishwasher in las vegas, that the hopes of the little girl who goes to the crumbling school in dillon are the same as the dreams of the boy who learns on the streets of l.a.
, we will remember that there is something happening in america, that we are not as divided as our politics suggest, that we are one people, we are one nation.
and, together, we will begin the next great chapter in the american story, with three words that will ring from coast to coast, from sea to shining sea: yes, we can.
thank you, new hampshire.
thank you.
thank you.
thank you, iowa.
you know, they said --
they said --
they said this day would never come.
they said our sights were set too high.
they said this country was too divided, too disillusioned to ever come together around a common purpose.
but on this january night, at this defining moment in history, you have done what the cynics said we couldn't do.
you have done what the state of new hampshire can do in five days.
you have done what america can do in this new year, 2008.
in lines that stretched around schools and churches, in small towns and in big cities, you came together as democrats, republicans, and independents, to stand up and say that we are one nation.
we are one people.
and our time for change has come.
you said the time has come to move beyond the bitterness and pettiness and anger
that's consumed washington; to end the political strategy that's been all about division, and instead make it about addition; to build a coalition for change that stretches through red states and blue states; because that's how we'll win in november, and that's how we'll finally meet the challenges that we face as a nation.
we are choosing hope over fear.
we're choosing unity over division, and sending a powerful message that change is coming to america.
you said the time has come to tell the lobbyists who think their money and their influence speak louder than our voices that they don't own this government -- we do.
and we are here to take it back.
the time has come for a president who will be honest about the choices and the challenges we face, who will listen to you and learn from you, even when we disagree, who won't just tell you what you want to hear, but what you need to know.
and in new hampshire, if you give me the same chance that iowa did tonight, i will be that president for america.
i'll be a president who finally makes health care affordable and available to every single american, the same way i expanded health care in illinois, by -- by bringing democrats and republicans together to get the job done.
i'll be a president who ends the tax breaks for companies that ship our jobs overseas and put a middle-class tax cut into the pockets of working americans who deserve it.
i'll be a president who harnesses the ingenuity of farmers and scientists and entrepreneurs to free this nation from the tyranny of oil once and for all.
and i'll be a president who ends this war in iraq and finally brings our troops home, who restores our moral standing, who understands that 9/11 is not a way to scare up votes but a challenge that should unite america and the world against the common threats of the 21st century -- common threats of terrorism and nuclear weapons, climate change and poverty, genocide and disease.
tonight, we are one step closer to that vision of america because of what you did here in iowa.
and so i'd especially like to thank the organizers and the precinct captains, the volunteers and the staff who made this all possible.
and while i'm at it on thank you's, i think it makes sense for me to thank the love of my life, the rock of the obama family, the closer on the campaign trail: give it up for michelle obama.
i know you didn't do this for me.
you did this -- you did this because you believed so deeply in the most american of ideas -- that in the face of impossible odds, people who love this country can change it.
i know this.
i know this because while i may be standing here tonight, i'll never forget that my journey began on the streets of chicago doing what so many of you have done for this campaign and all the campaigns here in iowa: organizing and working and fighting to make people's lives just a little bit better.
i know how hard it is.
it comes with little sleep, little pay, and a lot of sacrifice.
there are days of disappointment.
but sometimes, just sometimes, there are nights like this: a night -- a night that, years from now, when we've made the changes we believe in, when more families can afford to see a doctor, when our children -- when malia and sasha and your children inherit a planet that's a little cleaner and safer, when the world sees america differently, and america sees itself as a nation less divided and more united, you'll be able to look back with pride and say that this was the moment when it all began.
this was the moment when the improbable beat what washington always said was inevitable.
this was the moment when we tore down barriers that have divided us for too long; when we rallied people of all parties and ages to a common cause; when we finally gave americans who had never participated in politics a reason to stand up and to do so.
this was the moment when we finally beat back the poli[tics] of fear and doubt and cynicism, the politics where we tear each other down instead of lifting this country up.
this was the moment.
years from now, you'll look back and you'll say that this was the moment, this was the place where america remembered what it means to hope.
for many months, we've been teased, even derided for talking about hope.
but we always knew that hope is not blind optimism.
it's not ignoring the enormity of the tasks ahead or the roadblocks that stand in our path.
it's not sitting on the sidelines or shirking from a fight.
hope is that thing inside us that insists, despite all the evidence to the contrary, that something better awaits us if we have the courage to reach for it and to work for it and to fight for it.
hope is what i saw in the eyes of the young woman in cedar rapids who works the night shift after a full day of college and still can't afford health care for a sister who's ill -- a young woman who still believes that this country will give her the chance to live out her dreams.
hope is what i heard in the voice of the new hampshire woman who told me that she hasn't been able to breathe since her nephew left for iraq -- who still goes to bed each night praying for his safe return.
hope is what led a band of colonists to rise up against an empire, what led the greatest of generations to free a continent and heal a nation, what led young women and young men to sit at lunch counters and brave fire hoses and march through selma and montgomery for freedom's cause.
hope --
hope is what led me here today.
with a father from kenya, a mother from kansas, and a story that could only happen in the united states of america.
hope is the bedrock of this nation -- the belief that our destiny will not be written for us, but by us, by all those men and women who are not content to settle for the world as it is, who have the courage to remake the world as it should be.
that is what we started here in iowa
and that is the message we can now carry to new hampshire and beyond;
the same message we had when we were up and when we were down; the one that can save this country, brick by brick, block by block, calloused hand by calloused hand; that together, ordinary people can do extraordinary things.
because we are not a collection of red states and blue states.
we are the united states of america.
and in this moment, in this election, we are ready to believe again.
thank you, iowa.
thank you so much.
thank you so much.
to -- to the great governor of iowa and lieutenant governor of iowa; to my dear friend tom harkin for the outstanding work that he does; to the congressional delegation of iowa that is doing outstanding work; and to nancy pelosi, madam speaker, thank you all for the wonderful welcome and the wonderful hospitality.
i love you back.
[to audience]

a little less than one year from today, you will go into the voting booth and you will select the president of the united states of america.
now, here’s the good news -- the name george w. bush will not be on the ballot.
the name of my cousin dick cheney will not be on the ballot.
we’ve been trying to hide that for a long time.
everybody has a black sheep in the family.
the era of scooter libby justice, and brownie incompetence, and karl rove politics will finally be over.
but the question you’re going to have to ask yourself when you caucus in january
and you vote in november is, “what’s next for america?”
we are in a defining moment in our history.
our nation is at war.
the planet is in peril.
the dream that so many generations fought for feels as if it’s slowly slipping away.
we are working harder for less.
we’ve never paid more for health care or for college.
it’s harder to save
and it’s harder to retire.
and most of all we’ve lost faith that our leaders can or will do anything about it.
we were promised compassionate conservatism and all we got was katrina and wiretaps.
we were promised a uniter, and we got a president who could not even lead the half of the country that voted for him.
we were promised a more ethical and more efficient government, and instead we have a town called washington that is more corrupt and more wasteful than it was before.
and the only mission that was ever accomplished is to use fear and falsehood to take this country to a war that should have never been authorized and should have never been waged.
it is because of these failures that america is listening, intently, to what we say here today -- not just democrats, but republicans and independents who’ve lost trust in their government, but want to believe again.
and it is because of these failures that we not only have a moment of great challenge, but also a moment of great opportunity.
we have a chance to bring the country together in a new majority -- to finally tackle problems that george bush made far worse, but that had festered long before george bush ever took office -- problems that we’ve talked about year after year after year after year.
and that is why the same old washington textbook campaigns just won’t do in this election.
that’s why not answering questions ‘cause we are afraid our answers won’t be popular
just won’t do.that
’s why telling the american people what we think they want to hear instead of telling the american people what they need to hear just won’t do.
triangulating and poll-driven positions because we’re worried about what mitt or rudy might say about us just won’t do.
if we are really serious about wining this election democrats, we can’t live in fear of losing it.
this party -- the party of jefferson and jackson, of roosevelt and kennedy -- has always made the biggest difference in the lives of the american people when we led, not by polls, but by principle; not by calculation, but by conviction; when we summoned the entire nation to a common purpose -- a higher purpose.
and i run for the presidency of the united states of america because that’s the party america needs us to be right now.
a party that offers not just a difference in policies, but a difference in leadership.
a party that doesn’t just focus on how to win but why we should.
a party that doesn’t just offer change as a slogan, but real, meaningful change -- change that america can believe in.
that’s why i’m in this race.
that’s why i am running for the presidency of the united states of america -- to offer change that we can believe in.
i am in this race to tell the corporate lobbyists that their days of setting the agenda in washington are over.
i have done more than any other candidate in this race to take on lobbyists -- and won.
they have not funded my campaign, they will not get a job in my white house, and they will not drown out the voices of the american people when i am president.
i’m in this race to take those tax breaks away from companies that are moving jobs overseas and put them in the pockets of hard working americans who deserve it.
and i won’t raise the minimum wage every ten years -- i will raise it to keep pace so that workers don’t’ fall behind.
that is why i am in it.
to protect the american worker.
to fight for the american worker.
i’m in this race
because i want to stop talking about the outrage of 47 million americans without health care and start actually doing something about it.
i expanded health care in illinois by bringing democrats and republicans together.
by taking on the insurance industry.
and that is how i will make certain that every single american in this country has health care they can count on
and i won’t do it twenty years from now
, i won’t do it ten years from now, i will do it by the end of my first term as president of the united states of america.
i run for president to make sure that every american child has the best education that we have to offer -- from the day they are born to the day they graduate from college.
and i won’t just talk about how great teachers are -- as president i will reward them for their greatness -- by raising salaries and giving them more support.
that’s why i’m in this race.
i am running for president because i am sick and tired of democrats thinking that the only way to look tough on national security is by talking, and acting, and voting like george bush republicans.
when i am this party’s nominee, my opponent will not be able to say that i voted for the war in iraq; or that i gave george bush the benefit of the doubt on iran; or that i supported bush-cheney policies of not talking to leaders that we don’t like.
and he will not be able to say that i wavered on something as fundamental as whether or not it is ok for america to torture -- because it is never ok.
that’s why i am in it.
as president, i will end the war in iraq.
we will have our troops home in sixteen months.
i will close guantanamo.
i will restore habeas corpus.
i will finish the fight against al qaeda.
and i will lead the world to combat the common threats of the 21st century -- nuclear weapons and terrorism; climate change and poverty; genocide and disease.
and i will send once more a message to those yearning faces beyond our shores that says, “you matter to us.
your future is our future.
and our moment is now.”
america, our moment is now.
our moment is now.
i don’t want to spend the next year or the next four years re-fighting the same fights that we had in the 1990s.
i don’t want to pit red america against blue america, i want to be the president of the united states of america.
and if those republicans come at me with the same fear-mongering and swift-boating that they usually do, then i will take them head on.
because i believe the american people are tired of fear and tired of distractions and tired of diversions.
we can make this election not about fear, but about the future.
and that won’t just be a democratic victory; that will be an american victory.
and that is a victory america needs right now.
i am not in this race to fulfill some long-held ambitions or because i believe it’s somehow owed to me.
i never expected to be here, i always knew this journey was improbable.
i’ve never been on a journey that wasn’t.
i am running in this race because of what dr. king called “the fierce urgency of now.”
because i believe that there’s such a thing as being too late.
and that hour is almost upon us.
i don’t want to wake up four years from now and find out that millions of americans still lack health care because we couldn’t take on the insurance industry.
i don’t want to see that the oceans have risen a few more inches.
the planet has reached a point of no return because we couldn’t find a way to stop buying oil from dictators.
i don’t want to see more american lives put at risk because no one had the judgment or the courage to stand up against a misguided war before we sent our troops into fight.
i don’t want to see homeless veterans on the streets.
i don’t want to send another generation of american children to failing schools.
i don’t want that future for my daughters.
i don’t want that future for your sons.
i do not want that future for america.
i’m in this race for the same reason that i fought for jobs for the jobless and hope for the hopeless on the streets of chicago; for the same reason i fought for justice and equality as a civil rights lawyer; for the same reason that i fought for illinois families for over a decade.
because i will never forget that the only reason that i’m standing here today is because somebody, somewhere stood up for me when it was risky.
stood up when it was hard.
stood up when it wasn’t popular.
and because that somebody stood up, a few more stood up.
and then a few thousand stood up.
and then a few million stood up.
and standing up, with courage and clear purpose, they somehow managed to change the world.
that’s why i’m running, iowa -- to give our children and grandchildren the same chances somebody gave me.
that’s why i’m running, democrats -- to keep the american dream alive for those who still hunger for opportunity, who still thirst for equality.
that’s why i’m asking you to stand with me,
that’s why i’m asking you to caucus for me, that’s why i am asking you to stop settling for what the cynics say we have to accept.
in this election -- in this moment -- let us reach for what we know is possible.
a nation healed.
a world repaired.
an america that believes again.
thank you very much everybody.
thank you very much, mr. president.
mr. president, on thursdays senator durbin
and i hold a constituent coffee
so we can hear from the folks back home.
a young man came a few months ago who was about 25, 26 years old.
he had been in iraq for a year -- the first -- he had been back from iraq for a year.
the first six months of that year had been spent in a coma.
an explosion had shattered his face, blinded him in both eyes, has left him without the use of one arm.
he talked to us about how he was going through rehab.
he introduced us to his family.
he has a wife and two young daughters like i do, and his wife talked for a bit about the adjustments they were making at home since dad got hurt.
and i found myself looking at not just him, but his wife, who loves him so much.
and i thought about how their lives were forever changed because of the decision that was carried out four years ago.
the sacrifices of war are immeasurable.
i first made this point in the fall of 2002, at the end of the speech that i gave opposing the invasion of iraq.
i said then that i certainly do not oppose all wars.
rather, i oppose dumb wars, rash wars, wars that are based on passion as opposed to wars based on a sober assessment of our national security interests, because there's no decision more profound than the one we make to send our brave men and women into harm’s way.
i’ve thought about these words from time to time since that speech, but never so much as the day i saw that young man and his wife, and understood the degree to which their lives had been turn upside down.
the sacrifices of war are immeasurable.
too many have returned from iraq with that soldier’s story -- with broken bodies and shattered nerves and wounds that even the best care may not heal.
too many of our best have come home shrouded in the flag they loved.
too many moms and dads and husbands and wives have answered that knock on the door that’s hardest for any loved one to hear.
and the rest of us have seen too many promises of swift victories and dying insurgencies and budding democracy giving way to the reality of a brutal civil war that goes on and on and on to this day.
the sacrifices of war, mr. president, are immeasurable.
it was not impossible to see back then that we might arrive at the place we’re at today.
i said then that a war based not on reason but on passion, not on principle but on politics would lead to a u.s. occupation of undetermined length, at undetermined cost, with undetermined consequences.
i believed that an invasion of iraq without a clear rationale or strong international support would only strengthen the recruitment arm of al-qaeda and erode the good standing and moral authority that took our country generations to build.
there were other experts and leaders and everyday americans who believed this too.
i wish i had been wrong.
i wish we weren’t here talking about this at the beginning of the war’s fifth year -- because the consequences of this war have been profound.
and the sacrifices have been immeasurable.
mr. president, those who would have us continue this war in perpetuity like to say that this is a matter of resolve on behalf of the american people.
but the american people have been extraordinarily resolved.
they've seen their sons and daughters killed and wounded on the streets of fallujah.
they've spent hundreds of billions of dollars on this effort -- money that could have been devoted to strengthening our homeland and our competitive standing as a nation.
it is not a failure of resolve that has led us into this chaos but a failed strategy -- a strategy that has only strengthened iran’s strategic position, increased threats posed by terrorist organizations, reduced u.s. credibility and influence around the world, and placed israel and other nations [friendly] to the united states in the region in greater peril.
iraq has not been a failure of resolve; it has been a failure of strategy -- and that strategy must change.
it is time to bring a responsible end to u.s. involvement in this conflict is now.
it's become apparent, mr. president, that there's no military solution to this war.
no amount of u.s. soldiers -- not 10,000 more, not 20,000 more, not almost 30,000 more than we know -- that we know we are sending -- can solve the grievances that lay at the heart of someone else’s civil war.
our troops cannot serve as their diplomats, and we can no longer referee their civil war.
we must begin a phased withdrawal of our forces starting may 1st, with the goal of removing all combat forces by march 30th, 2008.
we also must make sure that we’re not as careless getting out of this war as we were getting in, and that’s why this withdrawal should be gradual, and maintain some u.s. troops in the region to prevent a wider war in the region, while they can also work on going after al qaeda and other terrorists.
but this phased withdrawal, mr. president, must begin soon.
letting the iraqis know that we will not be there forever is our last, best hope to pressure the iraqis to take ownership of their country and bring an end to their conflict.
it is time for our troops to start coming home.
history will not judge, mr. president, the architects of this war kindly.
but the books have yet to be written on our effort to right the wrongs we see in iraq.
the story has yet to be told about how we turned from this moment, found our way out of the desert, and took to heart the lessons of war that too many refused to heed back then; for it is of little use or comfort to recall past advice and warnings if we do not allow them to guide us in the challenges that lie ahead.
mr. president, threats loom large in an age where terrorist networks thrive, and there will certainly be times when we have to call on our brave servicemen and women to risk their lives again.
but before we make that most profound of all decisions, before we send our best off to battle, we must remember what led us to this day and learn from the principles that follow.
we must remember that ideology is not a foreign policy.
we must not embark on a war based on untested theories, political agendas, or wishful thinking that has basis -- that has little basis in fact or reality.
we must focus our efforts on the threats we know exist, and we must evaluate those threats with sound intelligence that is never manipulated for political reasons.
mr. president, we must remember that the cost of going it alone is immense.
it is a choice we sometimes have to make, but one [that] must be made rarely and always reluctantly.
that's because america’s standing in the world is a precious resource not easily rebuilt.
we value the cooperation and goodwill of other nations not because it makes us feel good, but because it makes all the world safer; because the only way to battle 21st century threats that race across the borders -- threats like terror and disease and nuclear proliferation -- is to enlist the resources and support of all nations.
to win our wider struggle, we must let people across this planet know that there is another, more hopeful alternative to the hateful ideologies
the terrorists espouse -- and renewed -- and a renewed america will reflect and champion that vision.
mr. president, we must remember that planning for peace is just as critical as planning for war.
iraq was not just a failure of conception but a failure of execution, and so when a conflict does arise that requires our involvement, we must understand that country’s history, its politics, its ethnic and religious divisions before our troops ever set foot on its soil.
we must understand that setting up ballot boxes does not a democracy make -- that real freedom and real stability come from doing the hard work of helping to build a strong police force, and a legitimate government, and ensuring that people have food, and water, and electricity, and basic services.
and we must be honest about how much of that we can do ourselves and how much must come from the people themselves.
finally, mr. president, we must remember that when we send our servicemen and women to war, we make sure we give them the training they need, and the equipment that will keep them safe, and a mission that they can accomplish.
we must respect our commanders’ advice not just when its politically convenient, but
even when it’s not what we want to hear.
and when our troops come home, it is our most solemn responsibility to make sure they come home to the services, and the benefits, and the care they deserve.
as we stand at the beginning of the fifth year of this war, mr. president, let us remember -- let us remember that young man from illinois, and his wife, and his daughters, and the thousands upon thousands of families who are living the very real consequences and immeasurable sacrifices that have come from our decision to invade iraq.
we are so blessed in this country to have so many men and women like this -- americans willing to put on that uniform, and say the hard goodbyes, and risk their lives in a far off land because they know that such consequences and sacrifices are sometimes necessary to defend our country and achieve a lasting peace.
that is why we have no greater responsibility than to ensure the decision to place them in harm’s
way is the right one.
and that is why we must learn the lessons of iraq.
it is what we owe our soldiers.
it is what we owe their families.
and it is what we owe our country -- now, and all the days and months to come.
thank you, mr. president.
i yield the floor.
mr. president, i rise, first, to offer strong words of support for the statement that was just offered by the distinguished senator from massachusetts.
i, as well, rise today to speak in support of the iraq resolution that the senate will consider tomorrow.
mr. president, the news from iraq is very bad.
last week, a suicide bomber stood outside a bookstore and killed 20 people.
other attacks killed 118 shia pilgrims.
on sunday, a car bomb went off in central baghdad, and more than 30 people died.
and the road from the airport into baghdad is littered with smoldering debris, craters from improvised explosive devices, and the memories of our sons and daughters.
mr. president, the civil war in iraq rages on.
the insurgents have started to change their tactics.
they hide in buildings and along the streets and wait for our helicopters.
they've shot down at least eight u.s. helicopters in the last month.
more of our soldiers are dying and coming home with their bodies broken and their nerves shattered at a va system completely unprepared for what they need to rebuild their lives.
mr. president, it is not enough for the president to tell us that victory in this war is simply a matter of american resolve.
the american people have been extraordinarily resolved.
they've seen their sons and daughters killed or wounded in the streets of fallujah.
they've spent hundreds of billions of dollars on this effort -- money that they know could have been devoted to strengthening our homeland security and our competitive standing as a nation.
the failure has not been a failure of resolve.
that's not what's led us into chaos.
it's been a failure of strategy; and it's time that the strategy change.
there is no military solution, mr. president, to the civil war that rages on in iraq; and it's time for us to redeploy so that a political solution becomes possible.
the news from iraq is very bad, and it's been that way for at least four years.
we all wish the --
that the land the president and the vice president speak of exists.
we wish that there was an iraq where the insurgency was in the last throes, where the people work with security, where children play outside, where a vibrant new democracy lights up the nighttime sky.
we wish for those things, but there's no alternative reality to what we see and read about in the news, to what we've experienced these long four years.
i repeat, mr. president, there is no military solution to this war.
at this point, no amount of soldiers can solve the grievances at the heart of someone else's civil war.
the iraqi people -- shia, sunni, and kurd -- must come to the table and reach a political settlement themselves.
if they want peace, they must do the hard work necessary to achieve it.
our failed strategy in iraq has strengthened iran's strategic position, reduced u.s. credibility and influence around the world, placed israel and other nations friendly to the united states in the region in greater peril.
these are not the signs of a well-laid plan.
it's time for a profound change.
this is what we're trying to do here today.
we're saying it is time to start making plans to redeploy our troops so that they can focus on the wider struggle against terrorism, win the war in afghanistan, strengthen our position in the middle east, and pressure the iraqis to reach a political settlement.
even if this effort falls short, we will continue to try to accomplish what the american people asked for last november.
i'm glad to see, though, that this new effort is gaining consensus.
and i want to commend senator reid for his efforts.
he took the time to listen -- so many of us from both chambers of congress could help develop this plan.
the decision in particular to begin a phased redeployment, with the goal of redeploying all our combat forces by march 31st, 2008, is the right step.
it's a measure the iraq study group spoke of, an idea i borrowed from them, an idea that, in a bill i introduced, now has more than 60 cosponsors from house and senate and from both sides of the aisle.
they've supported this plan since i announced a similar plan in january.
the decision allows some u.s. forces to remain in iraq with a clear mission to protect u.s. and coalition personnel, conduct counterterrorism operations, and to train and equip iraqi forces; and that is a smart decision.
president al-maliki spoke at a conference and warned that the violence in iraq could spread throughout the region if it goes unchecked.
by maintaining a strong presence in iraq and the middle east, as both my bill and the leadership bill does, we can ensure that the chaos does not spread.
i should also add that the decision to begin this phased redeployment within 120 days is a practical one.
our military options have been exhausted.
it's time to seek a political solution to this war, and with this decision we send a clear signal to the parties involved that they need to arrive at an accommodation.
mr. president, while i strongly believe that this war never should have been authorized, i believe we must be as careful in ending the war as we were careless getting in.
while i prefer my approach, as reflected in my bill, i believe that this new resolution does begin to point u.s. policy in iraq and the region in the right direction.
an end to the war, and achieving a political solution to iraq's civil war, will not happen unless we demand it.
peace with stability doesn't just happen because we wish for it.
it comes when we never give in and never give up and never tire of working towards a life on earth worthy of our human dignity.
the decisions that have been made have led us to this crossroads -- a moment of great peril, mr. president.
we have a choice.
we can continue down the road that's weakened our credibility and damaged our strategic interests in the region or we can turn toward the future.
the road won't be smooth, and i have to say, mr. president, that there will be risks with any approach.
but this approach is our last best hope to end this war
so we can begin to bring our troops home and begin the hard work of securing our country and our world from the threats that we face.
the president has said he will continue down the road towards more troops and more of the same failed policies.
the president sought and won authorization from congress to wage this war from the start.
but he is now dismissing and ignoring the will of the american people, that is tired of years of watching the human and financial tolls mount.
mr. president, the news from iraq is very bad, but it can change if we in this chamber say "enough.
"
let this day be the day that begins the painful and difficult work of moving from this crossroad.
let this be the day that we begin pulling towards the future with a responsible conclusion to this painful chapter in our nation's history.
mr. president, let this be the day when we finally send a message that is so clear and so emphatic that it cannot be ignored.
thank you, mr. president.
i yield the floor.
thank you...giving all praise and honor to god for bringing us here today.
i must begin because at the unity breakfast this morning i was saving for last and the list was so long i left him out after that introduction.
so i'm going to start by saying how much i appreciate the friendship and the support and the outstanding work that he does each and every day, not just in capitol hill but also back here in the district.
please give a warm round of applause for your congressman artur davis.
it is a great honor to be here.
reverend jackson, thank you so much.
to the family of brown a.m.e, to the good bishop kirkland, thank you for your wonderful message and your leadership.
i want to acknowledge one of the great heroes of american history and american life, somebody who captures the essence of decency and courage, somebody who i have admired all my life and were it not for him
, i'm not sure i'd be here today, congressman john lewis.
i'm thankful to him.
to all the distinguished guests and clergy, i'm not sure i'm going to thank reverend lowery because he stole the show.
i was mentioning earlier
, i know we've got c.t. vivian in the audience, and when you have to speak in front of somebody who martin luther king
said was the greatest preacher he ever heard, then you've got some problems.
and i'm a little nervous about following so many great preachers.
but i'm hoping that the spirit moves me and to all my colleagues who have given me such a warm welcome, thank you very much for allowing me to speak to you here today.
you know, several weeks ago, after i had announced that i was running for the presidency of the united states, i stood in front of the old state capitol in springfield, illinois; where abraham lincoln delivered his speech declaring, drawing in scripture, that a house divided against itself could not stand.
and i stood
and i announced that i was running for the presidency.
and there were a lot of commentators, as they are prone to do, who questioned the audacity of a young man like myself
, haven't been in washington too long.
and i acknowledge that there is a certain presumptuousness about this.
but i got a letter from a friend of some of yours named reverend otis moss jr.
in cleveland, and his son, otis moss iii is the pastor at my church
and i must send greetings from dr. jeremiah a. wright jr.
but i got a letter giving me encouragement and saying how proud he was that i had announced and encouraging me to stay true to my ideals and my values and not to be fearful.
and he said, if there's some folks out there who are questioning whether or not you should run, just tell them to look at the story of joshua because you're part of the joshua generation.
so i just want to talk a little about moses and aaron and joshua, because we are in the presence today of a lot of moseses.
we're in the presence today of giants whose shoulders we stand on, people who battled, not just on behalf of african americans but on behalf of all of america; that battled for america's soul, that shed blood , that endured taunts and formant and in some cases gave -- torment and in some cases gave the full measure of their devotion.
like moses, they challenged pharaoh, the princes, powers who said that some are atop and others are at the bottom, and that's how it's always going to be.
there were people like anna cooper and marie foster and jimmy lee jackson and maurice olette, c.t. vivian, reverend lowery, john lewis, who said we can imagine something different
and we know there is something out there for us, too.
thank god, he's made us in his image and we reject the notion that we will for the rest of our lives be confined to a station of inferiority, that we can't aspire to the highest of heights, that our talents can't be expressed to their fullest.
and so because of what they endured, because of what they marched; they led a people out of bondage.
they took them across the sea that folks thought could not be parted.
they wandered through a desert but always knowing that god was with them and that, if they maintained that trust in god, that they would be all right.
and it's because they marched that the next generation hasn't been bloodied so much.
it's because they marched that we elected councilmen, congressmen.
it is because they marched that we have artur davis and keith ellison.
it is because they marched that i got the kind of education i got, a law degree, a seat in the illinois senate and ultimately in the united states senate.
it is because they marched that i stand before you here today.
i was mentioning at the unity breakfast this morning, my -- at the unity breakfast this morning that my debt is even greater than that because not only is my career the result of the work of the men and women who we honor here today.
my very existence might not have been possible had it not been for some of the folks here today.
i mentioned at the unity breakfast that a lot of people been asking, well, you know, your father was from africa, your mother, she's a white woman from kansas.
i'm not sure that you have the same experience.
and i tried to explain, you don't understand.
you see, my grandfather was a cook to the british in kenya.
grew up in a small village and all his life, that's all he was -- a cook and a house boy.
and that's what they called him, even when he was 60 years old.
they called him a house boy.
they wouldn't call him by his last name.
sound familiar?
he had to carry a passbook around because africans in their own land, in their own country, at that time, because it was a british colony, could not move about freely.
they could only go where they were told to go.
they could only work where they were told to work.
yet something happened back here in selma, alabama.
something happened in birmingham that sent out what bobby kennedy called, "ripples of hope all around the world.
" something happened when a bunch of women decided they were going to walk instead of ride the bus after a long day of doing somebody else's laundry, looking after somebody else's children.
when men who had phd's decided that's enough and we're going to stand up for our dignity.
that sent a shout across oceans so that my grandfather began to imagine something different for his son.
his son, who grew up herding goats in a small village in africa could suddenly set his sights a little higher and believe that maybe a black man in this world had a chance.
what happened in selma, alabama and birmingham also stirred the conscience of the nation.
it worried folks in the white house who said, "you know, we're battling communism.
how are we going to win hearts and minds all across the world?
if right here in our own country, john, we're not observing the ideals set fort in our constitution, we might be accused of being hypocrites."
so the kennedy's decided we're going to do an air lift.
we're going to go to africa and start bringing young africans over to this country and give them scholarships to study
so they can learn what a wonderful country america is.
this young man named barack obama got one of those tickets and came over to this country.
he met this woman whose great great-great-great-grandfather had owned slaves; but she had a good idea
there was some craziness going on because they looked at each other and they decided that we know that the world as it has been it might not be possible for us to get together and have a child.
there was something stirring across the country because of what happened in selma, alabama, because some folks are willing to march across a bridge.
so they got together and barack obama jr. was born.
so don't tell me i don't have a claim on selma, alabama.
don't tell me i'm not coming home to selma, alabama.
i'm here because somebody marched.
i'm here because you all sacrificed for me.
i stand on the shoulders of giants.
i thank the moses generation; but we've got to remember, now, that joshua still had a job to do.
as great as moses was, despite all that he did, leading a people out of bondage, he didn't cross over the river to see the promised land.
god told him your job is done.
you'll see it.
you'll be at the mountain top and you can see what i've promised.
what i've promised to abraham and isaac and jacob.
you will see that i've fulfilled that promise
but you won't go there.
we're going to leave it to the joshua generation to make sure it happens.
there are still battles that need to be fought; some rivers that need to be crossed.
like moses, the task was passed on to those who might not have been as deserving, might not have been as courageous, find themselves in front of the risks that their parents and grandparents and great grandparents had taken.
that doesn't mean that they don't still have a burden to shoulder, that they don't have some responsibilities.
the previous generation, the moses generation, pointed the way.
they took us 90% of the way there.
we still got that 10% in order to cross over to the other side.
so the question, i guess, that i have today is what's called of us in this joshua generation?
what do we do in order to fulfill that legacy; to fulfill the obligations and the debt that we owe to those who allowed us to be here today?
now, i don't think we could ever fully repay that debt.
i think that we're always going to be looking back, but there are at least a few suggestions that i would have in terms of how we might fulfill that enormous legacy.
the first is to recognize our history.
john lewis talked about why we're here today.
but i worry sometimes -- we've got black history month, we come down and march every year, once a year.
we occasionally celebrate the various events of the civil rights movement, we celebrate dr. king's birthday, but it strikes me that understanding our history and knowing what it means, is an everyday activity.
moses told the joshua generation; don't forget where you came from.
i worry sometimes, that the joshua generation in its success forgets where it came from.
thinks it doesn't have to make as many sacrifices.
thinks that the very height of ambition is to make as much money as you can, to drive the biggest car and have the biggest house and wear a rolex watch and get your own private jet, get some of that oprah money.
and i think that's a good thing.
there's nothing wrong with making money, but if you know your history, then you know that there is a certain poverty of ambition involved in simply striving just for money.
materialism alone will not fulfill the possibilities of your existence.
you have to fill that with something else.
you have to fill it with the golden rule.
you've got to fill it with thinking about others.
and if we know our history, then we will understand that that is the highest mark of service.
second thing that the joshua generation needs to understand is that the principles of equality that were set fort and were battled for have to be fought each and every day.
it is not a one-time thing.
i was remarking at the unity breakfast on the fact that the single most significant concern that this justice department under this administration has had with respect to discrimination has to do with affirmative action.
that they have basically spent all their time worrying about colleges and universities around the country that are given a little break to young african americans and hispanics to make sure that they can go to college, too.
i had a school in southern illinois that set up a program for phd's in math and science for african americans.
and the reason they had set it up is because we only had less than 1% of the phd's in science and math go to african americans.
at a time when we are competing in a global economy, when we're not competing just against folks in north carolina or florida or california, we're competing against folks in china and india and we need math and science majors, this university thought this might be a nice thing to do.
and the justice department wrote them a letter saying we are going to threaten to sue you for reverse discrimination unless you cease this program.
and it reminds us that we still got a lot of work to do, and that the basic enforcement of anti-discrimination laws, the injustice that still exists within our criminal justice system, the disparity in terms of how people are treated in this country continues.
it has gotten better.
and we should never deny that it's gotten better.
but we shouldn't forget that better is not good enough.
that until we have absolute equality in this country in terms of people being treated on the basis of their color or their gender, that that is something that we've got to continue to work on and the joshua generation has a significant task in making that happen.
third thing -- we've got to recognize that we fought for civil rights, but we've still got a lot of economic rights that have to be dealt with.
we've got 46 million people uninsured in this country despite spending more money on health care than any nation on earth.
it makes no sense.
as a consequence, we've got what's known as a health care disparity in this nation because many of the uninsured are african american or latino.
life expectancy is lower.
almost every disease is higher within minority communities.
the health care gap.
blacks are less likely in their schools to have adequate funding.
we have less-qualified teachers in those schools.
we have fewer textbooks in those schools.
we got in some schools rats outnumbering computers.
that's called the achievement gap.
you've got a health care gap and you've got an achievement gap.
you've got katrina still undone.
i went down to new orleans three weeks ago.
it still looks bombed out.
still not rebuilt.
when 9/11 happened, the federal government had a special program of grants to help rebuild.
they waived any requirement that manhattan would have to pay 10% of the cost of rebuilding.
when hurricane andrew happened in florida, 10% requirement, they waived it because they understood that some disasters are so devastating that we can't expect a community to rebuild.
new orleans -- the largest national catastrophe in our history
, the federal government says where's your 10%?
there is an empathy gap.
there is a gap in terms of sympathizing for the folks in new orleans.
it's not a gap that the american people felt because we saw how they responded.
but somehow our government didn't respond with that same sense of compassion, with that same sense of kindness.
and here is the worst part, the tragedy in new orleans happened well before the hurricane struck because many of those communities, there were so many young men in prison, so many kids dropping out, so
little hope.
a hope gap.
a hope gap that still pervades too many communities all across the country and right here in alabama.
so the question is, then, what are we, the joshua generation, doing to close those gaps?
are we doing every single thing that we can do in congress in order to make sure that early education is adequately funded and making sure that we are raising the minimum wage so people can have dignity and respect?
are we ensuring that, if somebody loses a job, that they're getting retrained?
and that, if they've lost their health care and pension, somebody is there to help them get back on their feet?
are we making sure we're giving a second chance to those who have strayed and gone to prison but want to start a new life?
government alone can't solve all those problems, but government can help.
it's the responsibility of the joshua generation to make sure that we have a government that is as responsive as the need that exists all across america.
that brings me to one other point, about the joshua generation, and that is this -- that it's not enough just to ask what the government can do for us--
it's important for us to ask what we can do for ourselves.
one of the signature aspects of the civil rights movement was the degree of discipline and fortitude that was instilled in all the people who participated.
imagine young people, 16, 17, 20, 21, backs straight, eyes clear, suit and tie, sitting down at a lunch counter knowing somebody is going to spill milk on you
but you have the discipline to understand that you are not going to retaliate because in showing the world how disciplined we were as a people, we were able to win over the conscience of the nation.
i can't say for certain that we have instilled that same sense of moral clarity and purpose in this generation.
bishop, sometimes i feel like we've lost it a little bit.
i'm fighting to make sure that our schools are adequately funded all across the country.
with the inequities of relying on property taxes and people who are born in wealthy districts getting better schools than folks born in poor districts
and that's now how it's supposed to be.
that's not the american way.
but i'll tell you
what --
even as i fight on behalf of more education funding, more equity, i have to also say that , if parents don't turn off the television set when the child comes home from school and make sure they sit down and do their homework and go talk to the teachers and find out how they're doing, and if we don't start instilling a sense in our young children that there is nothing to be ashamed about in educational achievement, i don't know who taught them that reading and writing and conjugating your verbs was something white.
we've got to get over that mentality.
that is part of what the moses generation teaches us, not saying to ourselves we can't do something, but telling ourselves that we can achieve.
we can do that.
we got power in our hands.
folks are complaining about the quality of our government, i understand there's something to be complaining about.
i'm in washington.
i see what's going on.
i see those powers and principalities have snuck back in there, that they're writing the energy bills and the drug laws.
we understand that, but i'll tell you what.
i also know that, if cousin pookie would vote, get off the couch and register some folks and go to the polls, we might have a different kind of politics.
that's what the moses generation teaches us.
take off your bedroom slippers.
put on your marching shoes.
go do some politics.
change this country!
that's what we need.
we have too many children in poverty in this country and everybody should be ashamed, but don't tell me it doesn't have a little to do with the fact that we got too many daddies not acting like daddies.
don't think that fatherhood ends at conception.
i know something about that because my father wasn't around when i was young
and i struggled.
those of you who read my book know.
i went through some difficult times.
i know what it means when you don't have a strong male figure in the house, which is why the hardest thing about me being in politics sometimes is not being home as much as i'd like
and i'm just blessed that i've got such a wonderful wife at home to hold things together.
don't tell me that we can't do better by our children, that we can't take more responsibility for making sure we're instilling in them the values and the ideals that the moses generation taught us about sacrifice and dignity and honesty and hard work and discipline and self-sacrifice.
that comes from us.
we've got to transmit that to the next generation
and i guess the point that i'm making is that the civil rights movement wasn't just a fight against the oppressor; it was also a fight against the oppressor in each of us.
sometimes it's easy to just point at somebody else and say it's their fault, but oppression has a way of creeping into it.
reverend, it has a way of stunting yourself.
you start telling yourself, bishop, i can't do something.
i can't read.
i can't go to college.
i can't start a business.
i can't run for congress.
i can't run for the presidency.
people start telling you-- you can't do something, after a while, you start believing it and part of what the civil rights movement was about was recognizing that we have to transform ourselves in order to transform the world.
mahatma gandhi, great hero of dr. king and the person who helped create the nonviolent movement around the world
; he once said that you can't change the world if you haven't changed.
if you want to change the world, the change has to happen with you first and that is something that the greatest and most honorable of generations has taught us, but the final thing that i think the moses generation teaches us is to remind ourselves that we do what we do because god is with us.
you know, when moses was first called to lead people out of the promised land, he said i don't think i can do it, lord.
i don't speak like reverend lowery.
i don't feel brave and courageous and the lord said i will be with you.
throw down that rod.
pick it back up.
i'll show you what to do.
the same thing happened with the joshua generation.
joshua said, you know, i'm scared.
i'm not sure that i am up to the challenge, the lord said to him, every place that the sole of your foot will tread upon, i have given you.
be strong and have courage, for i am with you wherever you go.
be strong and have courage.
it's a prayer for a journey.
a prayer that kept a woman in her seat when the bus driver told her to get up, a prayer that led nine children through the doors of the little rock school, a prayer that carried our brothers and sisters over a bridge right here in selma, alabama.
be strong and have courage.
when you see row and row of state trooper facing you, the horses and the tear gas, how else can you walk?
towards them, unarmed, unafraid.
when they come start beating your friends and neighbors, how else can you simply kneel down, bow your head and ask the lord for salvation?
when you see heads gashed open and eyes burning and children lying hurt on the side of the road, when you are john lewis and you've been beaten within an inch of your life on sunday, how do you wake up monday and keep on marching?
be strong and have courage, for i am with you wherever you go.
we've come a long way in this journey, but we still have a long way to travel.
we traveled because god was with us.
it's not how far we've come.
that bridge outside was crossed by blacks and whites, northerners and southerners, teenagers and children, the beloved community of god's children, they wanted to take those steps together, but it was left to the joshua's to finish the journey moses had begun and today we're called to be the joshua's of our time, to be the generation that finds our way across this river.
there will be days when the water seems wide and the journey too far, but in those moments, we must remember that throughout our history, there has been a running thread of ideals that have guided our travels and pushed us forward, even when they're just beyond our reach, liberty in the face of tyranny, opportunity where there was none and hope over the most crushing despair.
those ideals and values beckon us still and when we have our doubts and our fears, just like joshua did, when the road looks too long and it seems like we may lose our way, remember what these people did on that bridge.
keep in your heart the prayer of that journey, the prayer that god gave to joshua.
be strong and have courage in the face of injustice.
be strong and have courage in the face of prejudice and hatred, in the face of joblessness and helplessness and hopelessness.
be strong and have courage, brothers and sisters, those who are gathered here today, in the face of our doubts and fears, in the face of skepticism, in the face of cynicism, in the face of a mighty river.
be strong and have courage and let us cross over that promised land together.
thank you so much everybody.
god bless you.
hello springfield!
...
look at all of you.
look at all of you.
goodness.
thank you so much.
thank you so much.
giving all praise and honor to god for bringing us here today.
thank you so much.
i am --
i am so grateful to see all of you.
you guys are still cheering back there?
[to audience on left.]
let me -- let me begin by saying thanks to all you who've traveled, from far and wide, to brave the cold today.
i know it's a little chilly -- but i'm fired up.
you know, we all made this journey for a reason.
it's humbling to see a crowd like this, but in my heart i know you didn't just come here for me.
you...came here because you believe in what this country can be.
in the face of war, you believe there can be peace.
in the face of despair, you believe there can be hope.
in the face of a politics that shut you out, that's told you to settle, that's divided us for too long, you believe that we can be one people, reaching for what's possible, building that more perfect union.
that's the journey we're on today.
but let me tell you how i came to be here.
as most of you know, i'm not a native of this great state.
i
-- i moved to illinois over two decades ago.
i was a young man then, just a year out of college.
i knew no one in chicago when i arrived, was without money or family connections.
but a group of churches had offered me a job as a community organizer for the grand sum of 13,000 dollars a year.
and i accepted the job, sight unseen, motivated then by a single, simple, powerful idea: that i might play a small part in building a better america.
my work took me to some of chicago's poorest neighborhoods.
i joined with pastors and lay-people to deal with communities that had been ravaged by plant closings.
i saw that the problems people faced weren't simply local in nature, that the decisions to close a steel mill was made by distant executives, that the lack of textbooks and computers in a school could be traced to skewed priorities of politicians a thousand miles away, and that when a child turns to violence -- i came to realize that -- there's a hole in that boy's heart that no government alone can fill.
it was in these neighborhoods that i received the best education that i ever had, and where i learned the meaning of my christian faith.
after three years of this work, i went to law school, because i wanted to understand how the law should work for those in need.
i became a civil rights lawyer, and taught constitutional law, and after a time, i came to understand that our cherished rights of liberty and equality depend on the active participation of an awakened electorate.
it was with these ideas in mind that i arrived in this capital city as a state senator.
it
-- it was here, in springfield, where i saw all that is america converge -- farmers and teachers, businessmen and laborers, all of them with a story to tell, all of them seeking a seat at the table, all of them clamoring to be heard.
i made lasting friendships here, friends that i see here in the audience today.
it was here -- it was here where we learned to disagree without being disagreeable; that it's possible to compromise so long as you know those principles that can never be compromised; and that so long as we're willing to listen to each other, we can assume the best in people instead of the worst.
that's why we were able to reform a death penalty system that was broken; that's why we were able to give health insurance to children in need; that's why we made the tax system right here in springfield more fair and just for working families; and that's why we passed ethics reform that the cynics said could never, ever be passed.
it was here, in springfield, where north, south, east, and west come together that i was reminded of the essential decency of the american people -- where i came to believe that through this decency, we can build a more hopeful america.
and that is why, in the shadow of the old state capitol, where lincoln once called on a house divided to stand together, where common hopes and common dreams still live, i stand before you today to announce my candidacy for president of the united states of america.
now -- now, listen, i --
i
... -- thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
[to audience chanting "obama"]
look, i --
i...recognize that there is a certain presumptuousness in this, a certain audacity, to this announcement.
i know that i haven't spent a lot of time learning the ways of washington.
but i've been there long enough to know that the ways of washington must change.
the genius of our founders is that they designed a system of government that can be changed.
and we should take heart, because we've changed this country before.
in the face of tyranny, a band of patriots brought an empire to its knees.
in the face of secession, we unified a nation and set the captives free.
in the face of depression, we put people back to work and lifted millions out of poverty.
we welcomed immigrants to our shores.
we opened railroads to the west.
we landed a man on the moon.
and we heard a king's call to let "justice roll down like waters, and righteousness like a mighty stream.
"
we've done this before: each and every time, a new generation has risen up and done what's needed to be done.
today we are called once more, and it is time for our generation to answer that call.
for that is our unyielding faith -- that in -- in the face of impossible odds, people who love their country can change it.
that's what abraham lincoln understood.
he had his doubts.
he had his defeats.
he had his skeptics.
he had his setbacks.
but through his will and his words, he moved a nation and helped free a people.
it's because of the millions who rallied to his cause that we're no longer divided, north and south, slave and free.
it's because men and women of every race, from every walk of life, continued to march for freedom long after lincoln was laid to rest, that today we have the chance to face the challenges of this millennium together, as one people -- as americans.
all of us know what those challenges are today: a war with no end, a dependence on oil that threatens our future, schools where too many children aren't learning, and families struggling paycheck to paycheck despite working as hard as they can.
we know the challenges.
we've heard them.
we've talked about them for years.
what's stopped us from meeting these challenges is not the absence of sound policies and sensible plans.
what's stopped us is the failure of leadership, the smallness -- the smallness of our politics -- the ease with which we're distracted by the petty and trivial, our chronic avoidance of tough decisions, our preference for scoring cheap political points instead of rolling up our sleeves and building a working consensus to tackle the big problems of america.
for the past six years we've been told that our mounting debts don't matter.
we've been told that the anxiety americans feel about rising health care costs and stagnant wages are an illusion.
we've been told that climate change is a hoax.
we've been told that tough talk and an ill-conceived war can replace diplomacy, and strategy, and foresight.
and when all else fails, when katrina happens, or the death toll in iraq mounts, we've been told that our crises are somebody else's fault.
we're distracted from our real failures, and told to blame the other party, or gay people, or immigrants.
and as people have looked away in disillusionment and frustration, we know what's filled the void: the cynics, the lobbyists, the special interests -- who've turned our government into a game only they can afford to play.
they write the checks and you get stuck with the bill.
they get the access while you get to write a letter.
they think they own this government, but we're here today to take it back.
the time for that kind of politics is over.
it is through.
it's time to turn the page -- right here and right now.
now look --
[audience chants "obama...obama...obama"]
okay.
alright.
thank you.
thank you.
thank you.
look, look, we have made some progress already.
i was proud to help lead the fight in congress that led to the most sweeping ethics reforms since watergate.
but washington has a long way to go, and it won't be easy.
that's why we'll have to set priorities.
we'll have to make hard choices.
and although government will play a crucial role in bringing about the changes that we need, more money and programs alone will not get us to where we need to go.
each of us, in our own lives, will have to accept responsibility -- for instilling an ethic of achievement in our children, for adapting to a more competitive economy, for strengthening our communities, and sharing some measure of sacrifice.
so let us begin.
let us begin this hard work together.
let us transform this nation.
let us be the generation that reshapes our economy to compete in the digital age.
let's set high standards for our schools and give them the resources they need to succeed.
let's recruit a new army of teachers, and give them better pay and more support in exchange for more accountability.
let's make college more affordable, and let's invest in scientific research, and let's lay down broadband lines through the heart of inner cities and rural towns all across america.
we can do that.
and as our economy changes, let's be the generation that ensures our nation's workers are sharing in our prosperity.
let's protect the hard-earned benefits their companies have promised.
let's make it possible for hardworking americans to save for retirement.
let's allow our unions and their organizers to lift up this country's middle-class again.
we can do that.
let's be the generation that ends poverty in america.
every single person willing to work should be able to get job training that leads to a job, and earn a living wage that can pay the bills, and afford child care so their kids can have a safe place to go when they work.
we can do this.
and let's be the generation that finally, after all these years, tackles our health care crisis.
we can control costs by focusing on prevention, by providing better treatment to the chronically ill, and using technology to cut the bureaucracy.
let's be the generation that says right here, right now: we will have universal health care in america by the end of the next president's first term.
we can do that.
let's be the generation that finally frees america from the tyranny of oil.
we can harness homegrown, alternative fuels like ethanol and spur the production of more fuel-efficient cars.
we can set up a system for capping greenhouse gases.
we can turn this crisis of global warming into a moment of opportunity for innovation, and job creation, and an incentive for businesses that will serve as a model for the world.
let's be the generation that makes future generations proud of what we did here.
most of all, let's be the generation that never forgets what happened on that september day and confront the terrorists with everything we've got.
politics doesn't have to divide us on this anymore; we can work together to keep our country safe.
i've worked with the republican senator dick lugar to pass a law that will secure and destroy some of the world's deadliest weapons.
we can work together to track down terrorists with a stronger military.
we can tighten the net around their finances.
we can improve our intelligence capabilities and finally get homeland security right.
but let's also understand that ultimate victory against our enemies will only come by rebuilding our alliances and exporting those ideals that bring hope and opportunity to millions of people around the globe.
we can do those things.
but all of this cannot come to pass until we bring an end to this war in iraq.
most of you know -- most of you know that i opposed this war from the start.
i thought it was a tragic mistake.
today we grieve for the families who have lost loved ones, the hearts that have been broken, and the young lives that could have been.
america, it is time to start bringing our troops home.
it's time -- it's time to admit that no amount of american lives can resolve the political disagreement that lies at the heart of someone else's civil war.
that's why i have a plan that will bring our combat troops home by march of 2008.
let the iraqis know -- letting the iraqis know that we will not be there forever is our last, best hope to pressure the sunni and shia to come to the table and find peace.
and there's one other thing that it's not too late to get right about this war, and that is the homecoming of the men and women, our veterans, who have sacrificed the most.
let us honor their courage by providing the care they need and rebuilding the military they love.
let us be the generation that begins that work.
i know there are those who don't believe we can do all these things.
i understand the skepticism.
after all, every four years, candidates from both parties make similar promises, and i expect this year will be no different.
all of us running for president will travel around the country offering ten-point plans and making grand speeches; all of us will trumpet those qualities we believe make us uniquely qualified to lead this country.
but too many times, after the election is over, and the confetti is swept away, all those promises fade from memory, and the lobbyists and special interests move in, and people turn away, disappointed as before, left to struggle on their own.
that's why this campaign can't only be about me.
it must be about us.
it must be about what we can do together.
this campaign must be the occasion, the vehicle, of your hopes, and your dreams.
it will take your time, your energy, and your advice to push us forward when we're doing right, and let us know when we're not.
this campaign has to be about reclaiming the meaning of citizenship, restoring our sense of common purpose, and realizing that few obstacles can withstand the power of millions of voices calling for change.
by ourselves, this change will not happen.
divided, we are bound to fail.
but the life of a tall, gangly, self-made springfield lawyer tells us that a different future is possible.
he tells us that there is power in words.
he tells us that there's power in conviction.
that beneath all the differences of race and region, faith and station, we are one people.
he tells us that there's power in hope.
as lincoln organized the forces arrayed against slavery, he was heard to say this: "of strange, discordant, and even hostile elements, we gathered from the four winds, and formed and fought to battle through.
"¹
that is our purpose here today.
that is why i am in this race -- not just to hold an office, but to gather with you to transform a nation.
i want -- i want to win that next battle -- for justice and opportunity.
i want to win that next battle -- for better schools, and better jobs, and better health care for all.
i want us to take up the unfinished business of perfecting our union, and building a better america.
and if you will join with me in this improbable quest, if you feel destiny calling, and see as i see, the future of endless possibility stretching out before us; if you sense, as i sense, that the time is now to shake off our slumber, and slough off our fears, and make good on the debt we owe past and future generations, then i am ready to take up the cause, and march with you, and work with you -- today.
together we can finish the work that needs to be done, and usher in a new birth of freedom on this earth.
thank you very much everybody -- let's get to work!
i love you.
thank you.
as many of you know, over the last few months i've been thinking hard about my plans for 2008.
running for the presidency is a profound decision -- a decision no one should make on the basis of media hype or personal ambition alone -- and so before i committed myself and my family to this race, i wanted to be sure that this was right for us and, more importantly, right for the country.
i certainly didn't expect to find myself in this position a year ago.
but as i've spoken to many of you in my travels across the states these past months, as i've read your emails and read your letters, i've been struck by how hungry we all are for a different kind of politics.
so i've spent some time thinking about how i could best advance the cause of change and progress that we so desperately need.
the decisions that have been made in washington these past six years, and the problems that have been ignored, have put our country in a precarious place.
our economy is changing rapidly, and that means profound changes for working people.
many of you have shared with me your stories about skyrocketing health care bills, the pensions you've lost and your struggles to pay for college for your kids.
our continued dependence on oil has put our security and our very planet at risk.
and we're still mired in a tragic and costly war that should have never been waged.
but challenging as they are, it's not the magnitude of our problems that concerns me the most.
it's the smallness of our politics.
america's faced big problems before.
but today, our leaders in washington seem incapable of working together in a practical, common sense way.
politics has become so bitter and partisan, so gummed up by money and influence, that we can't tackle the big problems that demand solutions.
and that's what we have to change first.
we have to change our politics, and come together around our common interests and concerns as americans.
this won't happen by itself.
a change in our politics can only come from you -- from people across our country who believe there's a better way and are willing to work for it.
years ago, as a community organizer in chicago, i learned that meaningful change always begins at the grassroots, and that engaged citizens working together can accomplish extraordinary things.
so even in the midst of the enormous challenges we face today, i have great faith and hope about the future -- because i believe in you.
and that's why i wanted to tell you first that i'll be filing papers today to create a presidential exploratory committee.
for the next several weeks, i'm going to talk with people from around the country, listening and learning more about the challenges we face as a nation, the opportunities that lie before us, and the role that a presidential campaign might play in bringing our country together.
and on february 10th, at the end of these discussions and in my home state of illinois, i'll share my plans with my friends, neighbors, and fellow americans.
in the meantime, i want to thank all of you for your time, your suggestions, your encouragement, and your prayers.
and i look forward to continuing our conversation in the weeks and months to come.
thank you lee, for hosting me here at the wilson center, and for your leadership of both the 9/11 commission and the iraq study group.
you have been a steady voice of reason in an unsteady time.
let me also say that my thoughts and prayers are with your colleague, haleh esfandiari, and her family.
i have made my position known to the iranian government.
it is time for haleh to be released.
it is time for haleh to come home.
thanks to the 9/11 commission, we know that six years ago this week president bush received a briefing with the headline:
“bin ladin determined to strike in u.s.”
it came during what the commission called the “summer of threat,” when the “system was blinking red” about an impending attack.
but despite the briefing, many felt the danger was overseas, a threat to embassies and military installations.
the extremism, the resentment, the terrorist training camps, and the killers were in the dark corners of the world, far away from the american homeland.
then, one bright and beautiful tuesday morning, they were here.
i was driving to a state legislative hearing in downtown chicago when i heard the news on my car radio
: a plane had hit the worldtrade center.
by the time i got to my meeting, the second plane had hit, and we were told to evacuate.
people gathered in the streets and looked up at the sky and the sears tower, transformed from a workplace to a target.
we feared for our families and our country.
we mourned the terrible loss suffered by our fellow citizens.
back at my law office, i watched the images from new york: a plane vanishing into glass and steel; men and women clinging to windowsills, then letting go; tall towers crumbling to dust.
it seemed all of the misery and all of the evil in the world were in that rolling black cloud, blocking out the september sun.
what we saw that morning forced us to recognize that in a new world of threats, we are no longer protected by our own power.
and what we saw that morning was a challenge to a new generation.
the history of americais one of tragedy turned into triumph.
and so a war over secession became an opportunity to set the captives free.
an attack on pearl harbor led to a wave of freedom rolling across the atlanticand pacific.
an iron curtain was punctured by democratic values, new institutions at home, and strong international partnerships abroad.
after 9/11, our calling was to write a new chapter in the american story.
to devise new strategies and build new alliances, to secure our homeland and safeguard our values, and to serve a just cause abroad.
we were ready.
americans were united.
friends around the world stood shoulder to shoulder with us.
we had the might and moral-suasion
that was the legacy of generations of americans.
the tide of history seemed poised to turn, once again, toward hope.
but then everything changed.
we did not finish the job against al qaeda in afghanistan.
we did not develop new capabilities to defeat a new enemy, or launch a comprehensive strategy to dry up the terrorists’ base of support.
we did not reaffirm our basic values, or secure our homeland.
instead, we got a color-coded politics of fear.
patriotism as the possession of one political party.
the diplomacy of refusing to talk to other countries.
a rigid 20th century ideology that insisted that the 21st century’s stateless terrorism could be defeated through the invasion and occupation of a state.
a deliberate strategy to misrepresent 9/11 to sell a war against a country that had nothing to do with 9/11.
and so, a little more than a year after that bright september day, i was in the streets of chicagoagain, this time speaking at a rally in opposition to war in iraq.
i did not oppose all wars, i said.
i was a strong supporter of the war in afghanistan.
but i said i could not support “a dumb war, a rash war” in iraq.
i worried about a “ u.s. occupation of undetermined length, at undetermined cost, with undetermined consequences” in the heart of the muslim world.
i pleaded that we “finish the fight with bin ladin and al qaeda.”
the political winds were blowing in a different direction.
the president was determined to go to war.
there was just one obstacle:
the u.s. congress.
nine days after i spoke, that obstacle was removed.
congress rubber-stamped the rush to war, giving the president the broad and open-ended authority he uses to this day.
with that vote, congress became co-author of a catastrophic war.
and we went off to fight on the wrong battlefield, with no appreciation of how many enemies we would create, and no plan for how to get out.
because of a war in iraq that should never have been authorized and should never have been waged, we are now less safe than we were before 9/11.
according to the national intelligence estimate, the threat to our homeland from al qaeda is “persistent and evolving.”
iraqis a training ground for terror, torn apart by civil war.
afghanistan is more violent than it has been since 2001.
al qaeda has a sanctuary in pakistan.
israel is besieged by emboldened enemies, talking openly of its destruction.
iranis now presenting the broadest strategic challenge to the united states in the middle east in a generation.
groups affiliated with or inspired by al qaeda operate worldwide.
six years after 9/11, we are again in the midst of a “summer of threat,” with bin ladin and many more terrorists determined to strike in theunited states.
what’s
more, in the dark halls of abu ghraib and the detention cells
ofguantanamo, we have compromised our most precious values.
what could have been a call to a generation has become an excuse for unchecked presidential power.
a tragedy that united us was turned into a political wedge issue used to divide us.
it is time to turn the page.
it is time to write a new chapter in our response to 9/11.
just because the president misrepresents our enemies does not mean we do not have them.
the terrorists are at war with us.
the threat is from violent extremists who are a small minority of the world’s 1.3 billion muslims, but the threat is real.
they distort islam.
they kill man, woman and child; christian and hindu, jew and muslim.
they seek to create a repressive caliphate.
to defeat this enemy, we must understand who we are fighting against, and what we are fighting for.
the president would have us believe that every bomb in baghdadis part of al qaeda’s war against us, not an iraqi civil war.
he elevates al qaeda in iraq – which didn’t exist before our invasion – and overlooks the people who hit us on 9/11, who are training new recruits inpakistan.
he lumps together groups with very different goals: al qaeda and iran, shiite militias and sunni insurgents.
he confuses our mission.
and worse – he is fighting the war the terrorists want us to fight.
bin ladin and his allies know they cannot defeat us on the field of battle or in a genuine battle of ideas.
but they can provoke the reaction we’ve seen in iraq: a misguided invasion of a muslim country that sparks new insurgencies, ties down our military, busts our budgets, increases the pool of terrorist recruits, alienates america, gives democracy a bad name, and prompts the american people to question our engagement in the world.
by refusing to end the war in iraq, president bush is giving the terrorists what they really want, and what the congress voted to give them in 2002:
a u.s. occupation of undetermined length, at undetermined cost, with undetermined consequences.
it is time to turn the page.
when i am president, we will wage the war that has to be won, with a comprehensive strategy with five elements: getting out of iraq and on to the right battlefield in afghanistan and pakistan; developing the capabilities and partnerships we need to take out the terrorists and the world
’s most deadly weapons; engaging the world to dry up support for terror and extremism; restoring our values; and securing a more resilient homeland.
the first step must be getting off the wrong battlefield in iraq, and taking the fight to the terrorists in afghanistan and pakistan.
i introduced a plan in january that would have already started bringing our troops out of iraq, with a goal of removing all combat brigades by march 31, 2008.
if the president continues to veto this plan, then ending this war will be my first priority when i take office.
there is no military solution in iraq.
only iraq
’s
leaders can settle the grievances at the heart of iraq’s civil war.
we must apply pressure on them to act, and our best leverage is reducing our troop presence.
and we must also do the hard and sustained diplomatic work in the region on behalf of peace and stability.
in ending the war, we must act with more wisdom than we started it.
that is why my plan would maintain sufficient forces in the region to target al qaeda within iraq.
but we must recognize that al qaeda is not the primary source of violence in iraq, and has little support – not from shia and kurds who al qaeda has targeted, or sunni tribes hostile to foreigners.
on the contrary, al qaeda’s appeal within iraq is enhanced by our troop presence.
ending the war will help isolate al qaeda and give iraqis the incentive and opportunity to take them out.
it will also allow us to direct badly needed resources to afghanistan.
our troops have fought valiantly there, but iraq has deprived them of the support they need—and deserve.
as a result, parts of afghanistan are falling into the hands of the taliban, and a mix of terrorism, drugs, and corruption threatens to overwhelm the country.
as president, i would deploy at least two additional brigades toafghanistan to re-enforce our counter-terrorism operations and support nato
’s efforts against the taliban.
as we step up our commitment, our european friends must do the same, and without the burdensome restrictions that have hampered nato’s efforts.
we must also put more of an afghan face on security by improving the training and equipping of the afghan army and police, and including afghan soldiers in u.s. and nato operations.
we must not, however, repeat the mistakes of iraq.
the solution in afghanistan is not just military – it is political and economic.
as president, i would increase our non-military aid by $1 billion.
these resources should fund projects at the local level to impact ordinary afghans, including the development of alternative livelihoods for poppy farmers.
and we must seek better performance from the afghan government, and support that performance through tough anti-corruption safeguards on aid, and increased international support to develop the rule of law across the country.
above all, i will send a clear message
: we will not repeat the mistake of the past, when we turned our back on afghanistan following soviet withdrawal.
as 9/11 showed us, the security of afghanistan and america is shared.
and today, that security is most threatened by the al qaeda and taliban sanctuary in the tribal regions of northwestpakistan.
al qaeda terrorists train, travel, and maintain global communications in this safe-haven.
the taliban pursues a hit and run strategy, striking in afghanistan, then skulking across the border to safety.
this is the wild frontier of our globalized world.
there are wind-swept deserts and cave-dotted mountains.
there are tribes that see borders as nothing more than lines on a map, and governments as forces that come and go.
there are blood ties deeper than alliances of convenience, and pockets of extremism that follow religion to violence.
it’s a tough place.
but that is no excuse.
there must be no safe-haven for terrorists who threaten america.
we cannot fail to act because action is hard.
as president, i would make the hundreds of millions of dollars inu.s.
military aid to pakistan conditional, and
i would make our conditions clear: pakistanmust make substantial progress in closing down the training camps, evicting foreign fighters, and preventing the taliban from using pakistan as a staging area for attacks inafghanistan.
i understand that president musharraf has his own challenges.
but let me make this clear.
there are terrorists holed up in those mountains who murdered 3,000 americans.
they are plotting to strike again.
it was a terrible mistake to fail to act when we had a chance to take out an al qaeda leadership meeting in 2005.
if we have actionable intelligence about high-value terrorist targets and president musharraf won’t act, we will.
and pakistan needs more than f-16s to combat extremism.
as the pakistani government increases investment in secular education to counter radical madrasas, my administration will increase america
’s commitment.
we must helppakistan invest in the provinces along the afghan border, so that the extremists’ program of hate is met with one of hope.
and we must not turn a blind eye to elections that are neither free nor fair – our goal is not simply an ally in pakistan, it is a democratic ally.
beyondpakistan, there is a core of terrorists – probably in the tens of thousands – who have made their choice to attack america.
so the second step in my strategy will be to build our capacity and our partnerships to track down, capture or kill terrorists around the world, and to deny them the world’s most dangerous weapons.
i will not hesitate to use military force to take out terrorists who pose a direct threat to america.
this requires a broader set of capabilities, as outlined in the army and marine corps’s new counter-insurgency manual.
i will ensure that our military becomes more stealth, agile, and lethal in its ability to capture or kill terrorists.
we need to recruit, train, and equip our armed forces to better target terrorists, and to help foreign militaries to do the same.
this must include a program to bolster our ability to speak different languages, understand different cultures, and coordinate complex missions with our civilian agencies.
to succeed, we must improve our civilian capacity.
the finest military in the world is adapting to the challenges of the 21st century.
but it cannot counter insurgent and terrorist threats without civilian counterparts who can carry out economic and political reconstruction missions – sometimes in dangerous places.
as president, i will strengthen these civilian capacities, recruiting our best and brightest to take on this challenge.
i will increase both the numbers and capabilities of our diplomats, development experts, and other civilians who can work alongside our military.
we can’t just say there is no military solution to these problems.
we need to integrate all aspects of american might.
one component of this integrated approach will be new mobile development teams that bring together personnel from the state department, the pentagon, and usaid.
these teams will work with civil society and local governments to make an immediate impact in peoples’ lives, and to turn the tide against extremism.
where people are most vulnerable, where the light of hope has grown dark, and where we are in a position to make a real difference in advancing security and opportunity – that is where these teams will go.
i will also strengthen our intelligence.
this is about more than an organizational chart.
we need leadership that forces our agencies to share information, and leadership that never – ever – twists the facts to support bad policies.
but we must also build our capacity to better collect and analyze information, and to carry out operations to disrupt terrorist plots and break up terrorist networks.
this cannot just be an american mission.
al qaeda and its allies operate in nearly 100 countries.
the united states cannot steal every secret, penetrate every cell, act on every tip, or track down every terrorist – nor should we have to do this alone.
this is not just about our security.
it is about the common security of all the world.
as president, i will create a shared security partnership program to forge an international intelligence and law enforcement infrastructure to take down terrorist networks from the remote islands ofindonesia, to the sprawling cities of africa.
this program will provide $5 billion over three years for counter-terrorism cooperation with countries around the world, including information sharing, funding for training, operations, border security, anti-corruption programs, technology, and targeting terrorist financing.
and this effort will focus on helping our partners succeed without repressive tactics, because brutality breeds terror, it does not defeat it.
we must also do more to safeguard the world’s most dangerous weapons.
we know al qaeda seeks a nuclear weapon.
we know they would not hesitate to use one.
yet there is still about 50 tons of highly enriched uranium, some of it poorly secured, at civilian nuclear facilities in over forty countries.
there are still about 15,000 to 16,00 nuclear weapons and stockpiles of uranium and plutonium scattered across 11 time zones in the former soviet union.
that is why i worked in the senate with dick lugar to pass a law that would help the united statesand our allies detect and stop the smuggling of weapons of mass destruction.
that is why i am introducing a bill with chuck hagel that seeks to prevent

nuclear terrorism, reduce global nuclear arsenals, and stop the spread of nuclear weapons.
and that is why, as president, i will lead a global effort to secure all nuclear weapons and material at vulnerable sites within four years.
while we work to secure existing stockpiles, we should also negotiate a verifiable global ban on the production of new nuclear weapons material.
and i won’t hesitate to use the power of american diplomacy to stop countries from obtaining these weapons or sponsoring terror.
the lesson of the bush years is that not talking does not work.
go down the list of countries we’ve ignored and see how successful that strategy has been.
we haven’t talked to iran, and they continue to build their nuclear program.
we haven’t talked to syria, and they continue support for terror.
we tried not talking to north korea, and they now have enough material for 6 to 8 more nuclear weapons.
it’s time to turn the page on the diplomacy of tough talk and no action.
it’s time to turn the page on washington’s conventional wisdom that agreement must be reached before you meet, that talking to other countries is some kind of reward, and that presidents can only meet with people who will tell them what they want to hear.
president kennedy said it best: “let us never negotiate out of fear, but let us never fear to negotiate.”
only by knowing your adversary can you defeat them or drive wedges between them.
as president, i will work with our friend and allies, but i won’t outsource our diplomacy in tehran to the europeans, or our diplomacy inpyongyang to the chinese.
i will do the careful preparation needed, and let these countries know whereamerica stands.
they will no longer have the excuse of american intransigence.
they will have our terms: no support for terror and no nuclear weapons.
but america must be about more than taking out terrorists and locking up weapons, or else new terrorists will rise up to take the place of every one we capture or kill.
that is why the third step in my strategy will be drying up the rising well of support for extremism.
when you travel to the world’s trouble spots as a united states senator, much of what you see is from a helicopter.
so you look out, with the buzz of the rotor in your ear, maybe a door gunner nearby, and you see the refugee camp in darfur, the flood near djibouti, the bombed out block in baghdad.
you see thousands of desperate faces.
al qaeda’s
new recruits come from africa and asia, the middle eastand europe.
many come from disaffected communities and disconnected corners of our interconnected world.
and it makes you stop and wonder: when those faces look up at an american helicopter, do they feel hope, or do they feel hate?
we know where extremists thrive.
in conflict zones that are incubators of resentment and anarchy.
in weak states that cannot control their borders or territory, or meet the basic needs of their people.
from africato central asia to the pacific rim– nearly 60

countries stand on the brink of conflict or collapse.
the extremists encourage the exploitation of these hopeless places on their hate-filled websites.
and we know what the extremists say about us.
america is just an occupying army in muslim lands, the shadow of a shrouded figure standing on a box at abu ghraib, the power behind the throne of a repressive leader.
they say we are at war with islam.
that is the whispered line of the extremist who has nothing to offer in this battle of ideas but blame – blameamerica, blame progress, blame jews.
and often he offers something along with the hate.
a sense of empowerment.
maybe an education at a madrasa, some charity for your family, some basic services in the neighborhood.
and then: a mission and a gun.
we know we are not who they say we are.
america is at war with terrorists who killed on our soil.
we are not at war with islam.
americais a compassionate nation that wants a better future for all people.
the vast majority of the world’s 1.3 billion muslims have no use for bin ladin or his bankrupt ideas.
but too often since 9/11, the extremists have defined us, not the other way around.
when i am president, that will change.
we will author our own story.
we do need to stand for democracy.
and i will.
but democracy is about more than a ballot box.
americamust show – through deeds as well as words – that we stand with those who seek a better life.
that child looking up at the helicopter must see america and feel hope.
as president, i will make it a focus of my foreign policy to roll back the tide of hopelessness that gives rise to hate.
freedom must mean freedom from fear, not the freedom of anarchy.
i will never shrug my shoulders and say – as secretary rumsfeld did – “freedom is untidy.
”
i will focus our support on helping nations build independent judicial systems, honest police forces, and financial systems that are transparent and accountable.
freedom must also mean freedom from want, not freedom lost to an empty stomach.
so i will make poverty reduction a key part of helping other nations reduce anarchy.
i will double our annual investments to meet these challenges to $50 billion by 2012.
and i will support a $2 billion global education fund to counter the radical madrasas – often funded by money from within saudi arabia– that have filled young minds with messages of hate.
we must work for a world where every child, everywhere, is taught to build and not to destroy.
and as we lead we will ask for more from our friends in europe and asia as well – more support for our diplomacy, more support for multilateral peacekeeping, and more support to rebuild societies ravaged by conflict.
i will also launch a program of public diplomacy that is a coordinated effort across my administration, not a small group of political officials at the state department explaining a misguided war.
we will open “america houses” in cities across the islamic world, with internet, libraries, english lessons, stories of america’s muslims and the strength they

add to our country, and vocational programs.
through a new “ america’s voice corps” we will recruit, train, and send out into the field talented young americans who can speak with – and listen to – the people who today hear about us only from our enemies.
as president, i will lead this effort.
in the first 100 days of my administration, i will travel to a major islamic forum and deliver an address to redefine our struggle.
i will make clear that we are not at war with islam, that we will stand with those who are willing to stand up for their future, and that we need their effort to defeat the prophets of hate and violence.
i will speak directly to that child who looks up at that helicopter, and my message will be clear:
“you matter to us.
your future is our future.
and our moment is now.”
this brings me to the fourth step in my strategy: i will make clear that the days of compromising our values are over.
major general paul eaton had a long and distinguished career serving this country.
it included training the iraqi army.
after abu ghraib, his senior iraqi advisor came into his office and said: “you have no idea how this will play out on the streets of baghdad and the rest of the arab world.
how can this be?”
this was not the america he had looked up to.
as the counter-insurgency manual reminds us, we cannot win a war unless we maintain the high ground and keep the people on our side.
but because the administration decided to take the low road, our troops have more enemies.
because the administration cast aside international norms that reflect american values, we are less able to promote our values.
when i am president, america will reject torture without exception.america is the country that stood against that kind of behavior, and we will do so again.
i also will reject a legal framework that does not work.
there has been only one conviction at guantanamo.
it was for a guilty plea on material support for terrorism.
the sentence was 9 months.
there has not been one conviction of a terrorist act.
i have faith in america’s courts, and i have faith in our jags.
as president, i will close guantanamo, reject the military commissions act, and adhere to the geneva conventions.
our constitution and our uniform code of military justice provide a framework for dealing with the terrorists.
this administration also puts forward a false choice between the liberties we cherish and the security we demand.
i will provide our intelligence and law enforcement agencies with the tools they need to track and take out the terrorists without undermining our constitution and our freedom.
that means no more illegal wire-tapping of american citizens.
no more national security letters to spy on citizens who are not suspected of a crime.
no more tracking citizens who do nothing more than protest a misguided war.
no more ignoring the law when it is inconvenient.
that is not who we are.
and it is not what is necessary to defeat the terrorists.
the fisa court works.
the separation of powers works.
our constitution

works.
we will again set an example for the world that the law is not subject to the whims of stubborn rulers, and that justice is not arbitrary.
this administration acts like violating civil liberties is the way to enhance our security.
it is not.
there are no short-cuts to protecting america, and that is why the fifth part of my strategy is doing the hard and patient work to secure a more resilient homeland.
too often this administration’s approach to homeland security has been to scatter money around and avoid hard choices, or to scare americans without telling them what to be scared of, or what to do.
a department set up to make americans feel safer
didn’t even show up when bodies drifted through the streets in new orleans.
that’s not acceptable.
my administration will take an approach to homeland security guided by risk.
i will establish a quadrennial review at the department of homeland security – just like at the pentagon – to undertake a top to bottom review of the threats we face and our ability to confront them.
and i will develop a comprehensive national infrastructure protection plan that draws on both local know-how and national priorities.
we have to put resources where our infrastructure is most vulnerable.
that means tough and permanent standards for securing our chemical plants.
improving our capability to screen cargo and investing in safeguards that will prevent the disruption of our ports.
and making sure our energy sector – our refineries and pipelines and power grids – is protected so that terrorists cannot cripple our economy.
we also have to get past a top-down approach.
folks across america are the ones on the front lines.
on 9/11, it was citizens – empowered by their knowledge of theworld trade center attacks – who protected our government by heroically taking action on flight 93 to keep it from reaching our nation’s capital.
when i have information that can empower americans, i will share it with them.
information sharing with state and local governments must be a two-way street, because we never know where the two pieces of the puzzle are that might fit together – the tip from afghanistan, and the cop who sees something suspicious on michigan avenue.
i will increase funding to help train police to gather information and connect it to the intelligence they receive from the federal government.
i will address the problem in our prisons, where the most disaffected and disconnected americans are being explicitly targeted for conversion by al qaeda and its ideological allies.
and my administration will not permit more lives to be lost because emergency responders are not outfitted with the communications capability and protective equipment their job requires, or because the federal government is too slow to respond when disaster strikes.
we’ve been through that on 9/11.
we’ve been through it during katrina.
i will ensure that we have the resources and competent federal leadership we need to support our communities when american lives are at stake.
but this effort can’t just be about what we ask of our men and women in uniform.
it can’t just be about how we spend our time or our money.
it’s about the kind of country we are.
we are in the early stages of a long struggle.
yet since 9/11, we’ve heard a lot about what americacan’t do or shouldn’t do or won’t even try.
we can’t vote against a misguided war iniraq because that would make us look weak, or talk to other countries because that would be a reward.
we can’t reach out to the hundreds of millions of muslims who reject terror because we worry they hate us.
we can’t protect the homeland because there are too many targets, or secure our people while staying true to our values.
we can’t get past the america of red and blue, the politics of who’s up and who’s down.
that is not the americathat i know.
theamerica
i know is the last, best hope for that child looking up at a helicopter.
it’s the country that put a man on the moon; that defeated fascism and helped rebuildeurope.
it’s
a country whose strength abroad is measured not just by armies, but rather by the power of our ideals, and by our purpose to forge an ever more perfect union at home.
that’s the americai know.
we just have to act like it again to write that next chapter in the american story.
if we do, we can keep americasafe while extending security and opportunity around the world.
we can hold true to our values, and in doing so advance those values abroad.
and we can be what that child looking up at a helicopter needs us to be: the relentless opponent of terror and tyranny, and the light of hope to the world.
to make this story reality, it’s going to take americans coming together and changing the fundamental direction of this country.
it’s going to take the service of a new generation of young people.
it’s going to take facing tragedy head-on and turning it into the next generation’s triumph.
that is a challenge that i welcome.
because when we do make that change, we’ll do more than win a war – we’ll live up to that calling to make america, and the world, safer, freer, and more hopeful than we found it.
mr. president, i rise today both humbled and honored by the opportunity to express my support for renewal of the expiring provisions of the voting rights act of 1965.
i want to thank the many people inside and outside congress who have worked so hard over the past year to get us here.
we owe a great debt of gratitude to the leadership on both sides of the aisle.
and we owe special thanks to chairmen sensenbrenner and specter, ranking members conyers and leahy, and representative mel watt.
without their work and dedication, and the support of voting rights advocates across the country, i doubt that this bill would have come before us so soon.
i want to thank both chambers and both sides of the aisle, as well, for getting this done with the same broad support that drove the original act 40 years ago.
at a time when americans are frustrated with the partisan bickering that too often stalls our work, the refreshing display of bipartisanship we're seeing today reflects our collective belief in the success of the act and reminds us of how effective we can be when we work together.
nobody can deny that we've come a long way since 1965.
look at the registration numbers.
only two years after the passage of the original act, registration numbers for minority voters in some states doubled.
soon after, not a single state covered by the voting rights act had registered less than half of its minority voting age population.
look at the influence of african-american elected officials at every single level of government.
there are african-american members of congress.
since 2001, our nation's top diplomat1 has been african american.
in fact, most of america's elected african-american officials come from states covered by section 5 of the voting rights act -- states like mississippi, and alabama, louisiana, and georgia.
but to me, the most striking evidence of our progress can be found right across this building in my dear friend congressman john lewis, who was on the front lines of the civil rights movement, risking life and limb for freedom.
and on march 7th, 1965, he led 600 peaceful protesters, demanding the right to vote, across the edmund pettus bridge in selma, alabama.
now, i've often thought about the people on the edmund pettus bridge that day, not only john lewis and hosea williams, who led the march, but the hundreds of everyday americans who left their homes and their churches to join it -- blacks and whites, teenagers, children, teachers, bankers, shopkeepers --
what dr. king called a beloved community of god's children ready to stand for freedom.
and i wonder sometimes -- where did they find that kind of courage?
you know, when you're facing row after row of state troopers on horseback, armed with billy clubs and tear gas -- when they're coming toward you spewing hatred and violence, how do you simply stop, kneel down, and pray to the lord for salvation?
but the most amazing thing of all is that after that day, after john lewis was beaten within an inch of his life, after people's heads were gashed open and their eyes were burned, and they watched their children's innocence literally beaten out of them -- after all that, they went back and marched again.
they marched again.
they crossed the bridge.
they awakened a nation's conscience.
and not five months later the voting rights act of 1965 was signed into law.
it was reauthorized in 1970, in 1975, and 1982.
now, in 2006 john lewis, the physical scars of those marches still visible, is an original cosponsor of the fourth reauthorization of the voting rights act.
and he was joined last week by 389 of his house colleagues in voting for its passage.
there were some in the house, and there may be some in the senate, who argue that the act is no longer needed, that the protections of section 5's "preclearance'' requirement" -- a requirement that ensures certain states are upholding the right to vote -- are targeting the wrong states.
unfortunately, the evidence refutes that notion.
of the 1100 objections issued by the department of justice since 1965, 56 [percent] occurred since the last reauthorization in 1982.
over half have occurred since 1982.
so despite the progress these states have made in upholding the right to vote, it's clear that problems still exist.
now, there are others who would argue that we shouldn't renew section 203's protection of language minorities.
these arguments have been tied to debates over immigration and they tend to muddle a noncontroversial issue -- protecting the right to vote -- with one of today's most contentious debates.
but let's remember, you can't request language assistance if you're not a voter.
and you can't be a voter if you are not a citizen.
and while voters, as citizens, must be proficient in english, many are simply more confident that they can cast ballots printed in their native languages without making errors.
it's not an unreasonable assumption.
a representative of the southwestern voter registration project is quoted as saying, (quote):
citizens who prefer spanish registration cards do so because they feel more connected to the process.
they also feel they trust the process more when they [fully] understand it.2
these sentiments, connection to and trust in our democratic process, are exactly what we want from our voting rights legislation.
our challenges, of course, don't end at reauthorizing the voting rights act.
we have to prevent the problems we've seen in recent elections from happening again.
we've seen political operatives purge voters from registration rolls for no legitimate reason, prevent eligible ex-felons from casting ballots, distribute polling equipment unevenly, and deceive voters about the time, location, and rules of elections.
and unfortunately, these efforts have been directed primarily at minority voters -- the disabled, low-income individuals, and other historically disenfranchised groups.
the help america vote act, or hava, was a big step in the right direction.
but we've got to do more.
we need to fully fund hava if we're going to move forward in the next stage of securing the right to vote for every citizen.
we need to enforce critical requirements like statewide registration databases.
we need to make sure polling equipment is distributed equitably and equipment actually works.
and we need to work on getting more people to the polls on election day.
we need to make sure that minority voters are not the subject of some deplorable intimidation tactics when they do go to the polls.
you know, in 2004 native american voters in south dakota were confronted by men posing as law enforcement.
these hired intimidators joked about jail time for ballot missteps and followed voters to their cars to record their license plates.
["]in lake county, ohio, some voters received a memo on bogus board of election[s] letterhead, informing voters who registered through democratic and naacp drives that they could not vote.["]3

in wisconsin, a flier purporting to be from the "milwaukee black voters league" was circulated in predominantly african-american neighborhoods with the following message: "if you've already voted in any election this year, you can't vote in the presidential election.
"if you violate any of these laws, you can get ten years in prison and your children will get taken away from you.
"4
now, think about that.
we've got a lot more work to do.
this occasion is a cause for celebration.
but it's also an opportunity to renew our commitment to voting rights.
as congressman lewis said last week: it's clear that we've come a great distance, but we still have a great distance to go.5,6 now, the memory of selma still lives on in the spirit of the voting rights act.
since that day, the voting rights act has been a critical tool in ensuring that all americans not only have the right to vote but have the right to have their vote counted.
and those of us concerned about protecting those rights can't afford to sit on our laurels upon reauthorization of this bill.
we need to take advantage of this rare, united front and continue to fight to ensure unimpeded access to the polls of all americans.
in other words, we need to take the spirit that existed on that bridge, and we have to spread it across this country.
you know, two weeks after the first march was turned back, dr. king spoke, and he told a gathering of organizers and activists and community members -- he said that they should not despair because "the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice."
the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.
that's because of the work that each of us do that it bends toward justice.
it's because of people like john lewis and fannie lou hamer and coretta scott king and rosa parks -- all the giants upon whose shoulders we stand -- that we are beneficiaries of that arc bending toward justice.
that's why i stand here today.
i would not be in the united states senate
had it not been for the efforts and courage of so many parents and grandparents and ordinary people who were willing to reach up and bend that arc in the direction of justice.
i hope we continue to see that spirit live on not just during this debate but throughout all our work here in the senate.
thank you, mr. president.
i yield the floor.
thank you very much, mr. president.
today, we mourn the passing of coretta scott king.
and when i think about coretta scott king, i think about the little girl who walked five miles to school on those rural alabama roads and felt the heat of racism each day she passed the door of the whites-only school, so much closer to home.
it didn't matter, because she studied and succeeded and excelled beyond most of her classmates, black and white.
she earned a college degree, and an acceptance to a prestigious graduate school up north.
and one day she met a young preacher from atlanta, and she fell in love with him.
and he told her his dreams -- and she believed in those dreams.
and she decided that she would help to make them real -- not just as a wife or as a friend, but as a partner in freedom's cause.
over the next years, coretta scott king did that in so many ways we can't even imagine.
she raised a family, she marched through the streets, she inspired through song, she led through speech -- even dodged the countless attempts on her family's life.
and one of -- when one of those attempts finally took her love from this world, she made the selfless decision to carry on.
with no time to even cry or mourn, to wallow in anger or vengeance, coretta scott king took to the streets just four days after the assassination and led 50,000 through the streets of memphis in a march for the kind of justice that her husband had given his life for.
she spent the rest of here marching for that same justice -- leading the king center for nonviolent social change in atlanta, and spreading her family's message of hope to every corner of this world.
you know, i had the great honor of -- of knowing mrs. king, and the occasion to visit with her in atlanta last year.
she was an extraordinarily gracious woman.
we sat and chatted in her living room.
we
-- she showed me an album of photographs of her and dr. king and the children.
and then she told me what her husband had said to her once, at a time when she was feeling burdened, understandably, by all the stress and strain that had been placed on the family as a consequence of his role in the civil rights movement.
she said her husband suggested that:

when you are willing to make sacrifices for a great cause, you will never be alone because you will have divine companionship and the support of good people.
that was her husband's advice to her -- that when you are willing to make sacrifices for a great cause, you will never be alone.
coretta scott king died in her sleep last night.
she certainly was not alone.
she was joined by the companionship and support of a loving family and a grateful nation -- inspired by her cause, dedicated to her work, and mournful of her passing.
my thoughts, condolences today are with her children.
and i ask that she and her husband now rest together in eternal peace.
thank you very much, mr. president.
you know, four years ago, following the most devastating attack in our history, this body passed the usa patriot act in order to give our nation's law enforcement the tools they needed to track down terrorists who plot and lurk within our own borders and all over the world; terrorists who, right now, are looking to exploit weaknesses in our laws and our security to carry out attacks that may be even deadlier than those that took place on september 11th.
we all agree that we need legislation to make it harder for suspected terrorists to go undetected in this country.
and we all agree that we needed to make it harder for them to organize and strategize and get flight licenses and sneak across our borders.
americans everywhere wanted to do that.
but soon after the patriot act passed, a few years before i even arrived here in the senate, i began hearing concerns from people of every background and political leaning that this law, the very purpose of which was to protect us, was also threatening to violate some of the rights and freedoms that we hold most dear; that it didn't just provide law enforcement the powers it needed to keep us safe but powers that it didn't need to invade our privacy without cause or suspicion.
now, in washington, this issue has tended to degenerate into the typical either/or debate: either we protect our people from terror or we protect our most cherished principles.
i would suggest, mr. president, that this is a false choice.
it asks too little of us and it assumes too little about america.
that's why, as it's come to time to reauthorize the usa patriot act, we've been working in a bipartisan way to do both -- to show american people that we can track down terrorists without trampling on our civil liberties, to show the american people that the federal government will only issue warrants and execute searches because it needs to do so, not because it can do so.
what we have been trying to achieve under the leadership of a bipartisan group of senators is some accountability in this process to get answers and see evidence where there is suspicion.
several weeks ago, these efforts bore fruit.
the judiciary committee and the u.s. -- u.s. senate managed to pass a piece of bipartisan legislation that, while i can't say is perfect, was able to address some of the most serious problems in the existing law.
unfortunately, that strong bipartisan legislation has been tossed aside in conference.
instead, we've been forced to consider a piece of rushed legislation that fails to address the concerns of members of both parties as well as the american people.
this is legislation that puts our own justice department above the law.
when national security letters are issued, they allow federal agents to conduct any search on any american, no matter how extensive, how wide ranging, without ever going before a judge to prove that the search is necessary.
all that is needed is a signoff from a local fbi agent.
that's it.
once a business or a person receives notification that they will be searched, they are prohibited from telling anyone about it
and they're even prohibited from challenging this automatic gag order in court.
even though judges have already found that similar restrictions violate the first amendment, this conference report disregards the case law and the right to challenge the gag order.
if you do decide to consult an attorney for legal advice, hold on.
you will have to tell the fbi that you've done so.
think about that
: you want to talk to a lawyer about whether or not your actions are going to be causing you to get into trouble, you've got to tell the fbi that you're consulting a lawyer.
this is unheard of.
there is no such requirement in any other area of the law.
i see no reason why it's justified here.
and if someone wants to know why their own government has decided to go on a fishing expedition through every personal record or private document, through the library books that you read, the phone calls that you've made, the e-mails that you've sent, this legislation gives people no rights to appeal the need for such a search in a court of law.
no judge will hear your plea; no jury will hear your case.
this is just plain wrong.
and there are republican senators as well as democratic senators that recognize that it's plain wrong.
giving law enforcement the tools they need to investigate suspicious activities is one thing
and it's the right thing; but doing it without any real oversight seriously jeopardizes the rights of all americans and the ideals america stands for.
now, supporters of this conference report have argued we should just hold our noses and support this legislation because it's not going to get any better.
that is not a good argument.
we can do better.
we've got time to do better.
it doesn't convince me that i should support this report.
i believe we owe it to the nation, we owe it to those who fought for our civil liberties, we owe it to the future and our children to make sure that we craft the kind of legislation that would make us proud, not just legislation that we would settle for because we're in a rush.
we don't have to settle for a patriot act that sacrifices our liberties or our safety.
we can have one that secures both.
now, there have been proposals on both sides of the aisle and in both houses of congress to extend the patriot act for three months so that we can reach an agreement on this bill that is well thought through.
i support these efforts and will oppose cloture on what i consider to be this unacceptable conference report.
mr. president, i thank you.
i yield the floor....
good morning president taylor, board of trustees, faculty, parents, family, friends, the community of galesburg, the class of 1955 -- which i understand was out partying last night, and yet still showed up here on time -- and most of all, the class of 2005.
congratulations on your graduation, and thank you -- thank you for the honor of allowing me to be a part of it.
thank you also, mr. president, for this honorary degree.
it was only a couple of years ago that i stopped paying my student loans in law school.
had i known it was this easy
, i would have ran [sic] for the united states senate earlier.
you know, it has been about six months now since you sent me to washington as your united states senator.
i recognize that not all of you voted for me, so for those of you muttering under your breath
"i didn’t send you anywhere," that's ok too.
maybe we’ll hold -- what do you call it?
-- a little pumphandle after the ceremony.
change your mind for the next time.
it has been a fascinating journey thus far.
each time i walk onto the senate floor, i'm reminded of the history, for good and for ill, that has been made there.
but there have been a few surreal moments.
for example, i remember the day before i was sworn in, myself and my staff, we decided to hold a press conference in our office.
now, keep in mind that i am ranked 99th in seniority.
i was proud that i wasn’t ranked dead last until i found out that it’s
just because illinois is bigger than colorado.
so i’m 99th in seniority, and all the reporters are crammed into the tiny transition office that i have, which is right next to the janitor’s closet in the basement of the dirksen office building.
it’s my first day in the building, i have not taken a single vote, i have not introduced one bill, had not even sat down in my desk, and this very earnest reporter raises his hand and says:

“senator obama, what is your place in history?”
i did what you just did, which is laugh out loud.
i said, "place in history?
" i thought he was kidding.
at that point, i wasn’t even sure the other senators would save a place for me at the cool kids’ table.
but as i was thinking about the words to share with this class, about what’s
next, about what’s possible, and what opportunities lay ahead, i actually think it’s not a bad question for you, the class of 2005, to ask yourselves: what will be your place in history?
in other eras, across distant lands, this question could be answered with relative ease and certainty.
as a servant in rome, you knew you’d spend your life forced to build somebody else’s empire.
as a peasant in 11th century china, you knew that no matter how hard you worked, the local warlord might come and take everything you had -- and you also knew that famine might come knocking at the door.
as a subject of king george, you knew that your freedom of worship and your freedom to speak and to build your own life would be ultimately limited by the throne.
and then america happened.
a place where destiny was not a destination, but a journey to be shared and shaped and remade by people who had the gall, the temerity to believe that, against all odds, they could form “a more perfect union” on this new frontier.
and as people around the world began to hear the tale of the lowly colonists who overthrew an empire for the sake of an idea, they started to come.
across oceans and the ages, they settled in boston and charleston, chicago and st. louis, kalamazoo and galesburg, to try and build their own american dream.
this collective dream moved forward imperfectly -- it was scarred by our treatment of native peoples, betrayed by slavery, clouded by the subjugation of women, shaken by war and depression.
and yet, brick by brick, rail by rail, calloused hand by calloused hand, people kept dreaming, and building, and working, and marching, and petitioning their government, until they made america a land where the question of our place in history is not answered for us.
it’s answered by us.
have we failed at times?
absolutely.
will you occasionally fail when you embark on your own american journey?
you surely will.
but the test is not perfection.
the true test of the american ideal is whether we’re able to recognize our failings and then rise together to meet the challenges of our time.
whether we allow ourselves to be shaped by events and history, or whether we act to shape them.
whether chance of birth or circumstance decides life’s big winners and losers, or whether we build a community where, at the very least, everyone has a chance to work hard, get ahead, and reach their dreams.
we have faced this choice before.
at the end of the civil war, when farmers and their families began moving into the cities to work in the big factories that were sprouting up all across america, we had to decide:  do we do nothing and allow captains of industry and robber barons to run roughshod over the economy and workers by competing to see who can pay the lowest wages at the worst working conditions?
or do we try to make the system work by setting up basic rules for the market, instituting the first public schools, busting up monopolies, letting workers organize into unions?
we chose to act, and we rose together.
when the irrational exuberance of the roaring twenties came crashing down with the stock market, we had to decide:
do we follow the call of leaders who would do nothing, or the call of a leader who, perhaps because of his physical paralysis, refused to accept political paralysis?
we chose to act -- regulating the market, putting people back to work, expanding bargaining rights to include health care and a secure retirement -- and together we rose.
when world war ii required the most massive home front mobilization in history and we needed every single american to lend a hand, we had to decide: do we listen to skeptics who told us it wasn’t possible to produce that many tanks and planes?
or, did we build roosevelt’s arsenal for democracy and grow our economy even further by providing our returning heroes with a chance to go to college and own their own home?
again, we chose to act, and again, we rose together.
today, at the beginning of this young century, we have to decide again.
but this time, it is your turn to choose.
here in galesburg, you know what this new challenge is.
you’ve seen it.
all of you, your first year in college saw what happened at 9/11.
it’s already been noted, the degree to which your lives will be intertwined with the war on terrorism that currently is taking place.
but what you’ve also seen, perhaps not as spectacularly, is the fact that when you drive by the old maytag plant around lunchtime, no one walks out anymore.
i saw it during the campaign when i met union guys who worked at the plant for 20, 30 years and now wonder what they’re gonna do at the age of 55 without a pension or health care; when i met the man who’s son needed a new liver but because he’d been laid off, didn’t know if he could afford to provide his child the care that he needed.
it’s as if someone changed the rules in the middle of the game and no wonder -- no one bothered to tell these folks.
and, in reality, the rules have changed.
it started with technology and automation that rendered entire occupations obsolete.
when was the last time anybody here stood in line for the bank teller instead of going to the atm, or talked to a switchboard operator?
then it continued when companies like maytag were able to pick up and move their factories to some under developed country where workers were a lot cheaper than they are in the united states.
as tom friedman points out in his new book, the world is flat, over the last decade or so, these forces -- technology and globalization -- have combined like never before.
so that while most of us have been paying attention to how much easier technology has made our own lives -- sending e-mails back and forth on our blackberries, surfing the web on our cell phones, instant messaging with friends across the world -- a quiet revolution has been breaking down barriers and connecting the world’s economies.
now business not only has the ability to move jobs wherever there’s a factory, but wherever there’s an internet connection.
countries like india and china realized this.
they understand that they no longer need to be just a source of cheap labor or cheap exports.
they can compete with us on a global scale.
the one resource they needed were skilled, educated workers.
so they started schooling their kids earlier, longer, with a greater emphasis on math and science and technology, until their most talented students realized they don’t have to come to america to have a decent life
-- they can stay right where they are.
the result?
china is graduating four times the number of engineers that the united states is graduating.
not only are those maytag employees competing with chinese and indian and indonesian and mexican workers, you are too.
today, accounting firms are e-mailing your tax returns to workers in india who will figure them out and send them back to you as fast as any worker in illinois or indiana could.
when you lose your luggage in boston at an airport, tracking it down may involve a call to an agent in bangalore, who will find it by making a phone call to baltimore.
even the associated press has outsourced some of their jobs to writers all over the world who can send in a story at a click of a mouse.
as prime minister tony blair has said, in this new economy, "talent is the 21st century wealth.
"
if you've got the skills, you've got the education, and you have the opportunity to upgrade and improve both
, you’ll be able to compete and win anywhere.
if not, the fall will be further and harder than it ever was before.
so what do we do about this?
how does america find its way in this new, global economy?
what will our place in history be?
like so much of the american story, once again, we face a choice.
once again, there are those who believe that there isn’t much we can do about this as a nation.
that the best idea is to give everyone one big refund on their government -- divvy it up by individual portions, in the form of tax breaks, hand it out, and encourage everyone to use their share to go buy their own health care, their own retirement plan, their own child care, their own education, and so on.
in washington, they call this the ownership society.
but in our past there has been another term for it -- social darwinism -- every man or woman for him or herself.
it’s a tempting idea, because it doesn’t require much thought or ingenuity.
it allows us to say that those whose health care or tuition may rise faster than they can afford -- tough luck.
it allows us to say to the maytag workers who have lost their job -- life isn’t fair.
it let’s
us say to the child who was born into poverty -- pull yourself up by your bootstraps.
and it is especially tempting because each of us believes we will always be the winner in life’s lottery, that we’re the one who will be the next donald trump, or at least we won’t be the chump who donald trump says: “you’re fired!”
but there is a problem.
it won’t work.
it ignores our history.
it ignores the fact that it’s been government research and investment that made the railways possible and the internet possible.
it’s been the creation of a massive middle class, through decent wages and benefits and public schools that allowed us all to prosper.
our economic dependence depended on individual initiative.
it depended on a belief in the free market; but it has also depended on our sense of mutual regard for each other, the idea that everybody has a stake in the country, that we’re all in it together and
everybody’s got a shot at opportunity.
that’s what’s produced our unrivaled political stability.
and so if we do nothing in the face of globalization, more people will continue to lose their health care.
fewer kids will be able to afford the diploma you’re about to receive.
more companies like united airlines won’t be able to provide pensions for their employees.
and those maytag workers will be joined in the unemployment line by any worker whose skills can be bought and sold on the global market.
so today i’m here to tell you what most of you already know.
this is not us -- the option that i just mentioned.
doing nothing.
it’s not how our story ends -- not in this country.
america is a land of big dreamers and big hopes.
it is this hope that has sustained us through revolution and civil war, depression and world war, a struggle for civil and social rights and the brink of nuclear crisis.
and it is because our dreamers dreamed that we have emerged from each challenge more united, more prosperous, and more admired than before.
so let’s dream.
instead of doing nothing or simply defending 20th century solutions, let’s imagine together what we could do to give every american a fighting chance in the 21st century.
what if we prepared every child in america with the education and skills they need to compete in the new economy?
if we made sure that college was affordable for everyone who wanted to go?
if we walked up to those maytag workers and
we said “your old job is not coming back, but a new job will be there because we’re going to seriously retrain you
and there’s life-long education that’s waiting for you -- the sorts of opportunities that knox has created with the strong futures scholarship program.
what
if no matter where you worked or how many times you switched jobs, you had health care and a pension that stayed with you always, so you all had the flexibility to move to a better job or start a new business?
what if instead of cutting budgets for research and development and science, we fueled the genius and the innovation that will lead to the new jobs and new industries of the future?
right now, all across america, there are amazing discoveries being made.
if we supported these discoveries on a national level, if we committed ourselves to investing in these possibilities, just imagine what it could do for a town like galesburg.
ten or twenty years down the road, that old maytag plant could re-open its doors as an ethanol refinery that turned corn into fuel.
down the street, a biotechnology research lab could open up on the cusp of discovering a cure for cancer.
and across the way, a new auto company could be busy churning out electric cars.
the new jobs created would be filled by american workers trained with new skills and a world-class education.
all of that is possible but none of it will come easy.
every one of us is going to have to work more, read more, train more, think more.
we will have to slough off some bad habits -- like driving gas guzzlers that weaken our economy and feed our enemies abroad.
our children will have to turn off the tv set once in a while and put away the video games and start hitting the books.
we’ll have to reform institutions, like our public schools, that were designed for an earlier time.
republicans will have to recognize our collective responsibilities, even as democrats recognize that we have to do more than just defend old programs.
it won’t be easy, but it can be done.
it can be our future.
we have the talent and the resources and brainpower.
but now we need the political will.
we need a national commitment.
and we need each of you.
now, no one can force you to meet these challenges.
if you want, it will be pretty easy for you to leave here today and not give another thought to towns like galesburg and the challenges they face.
there is no community service requirement in the real world; no one is forcing you to care.
you can take your diploma, walk off this stage, and go chasing after the big house, and the nice suits, and all the other things that our money culture says that you should want, that you should aspire to, that you can buy.
but i hope you don’t walk away from the challenge.
focusing your life solely on making a buck shows a certain poverty of ambition.
it asks too little of yourself.
you need to take up the challenges that we face as a nation and make them your own.
not because you have a debt to those who helped you get here, although you do have that debt.
not because you have an obligation to those who are less fortunate than you, although i do think you do have that obligation.
it’s primarily because you have an obligation to yourself.
because individual salvation has always depended on collective salvation.
because it’s only when you hitch your wagon to something larger than yourself that you realize your true potential.
and i know that all of you are wondering how you’ll do this, the challenges seem so big.
they seem so difficult for one person to make a difference.
but we know it can be done.
because where you’re sitting, in this very place, in this town, it’s happened before.
nearly two centuries ago, before civil rights, before voting rights, before abraham lincoln, before the civil war, before all of that, america was stained by the sin of slavery.
in the sweltering heat of southern plantations, men and women who looked like me could not escape the life of pain and servitude in which they were sold.
and yet, year after year, as this moral cancer ate away at the american ideals of liberty and equality, the nation was silent.
but its people didn’t stay silent for long.
one by one, abolitionists emerged to tell their fellow americans that this would not be our place in history -- that this was not the america that had captured the imagination of the world.
this resistance that they met was fierce, and some paid with their lives.
but they would not be deterred, and they soon spread out across the country to fight for their cause.
one man from new york went west, all the way to the prairies of illinois to start a colony.
and here in galesburg, freedom found a home.
here in galesburg, the main depot for the underground railroad in illinois, escaped slaves could roam freely on the streets and take shelter in people’s homes.
and when their masters or the police would come for them, the people of this town would help them escape north, some literally carrying them in their arms to freedom.
think about the risks that involved.
if they were caught abetting a fugitive, you could’ve been jailed or lynched.
it would have been simple for these townspeople to turn the other way; to go live their lives in a private peace.
and yet, they didn’t do that.
why?
because they knew that we were all americans; that we were all brothers and sisters; the same reason that a century later, young men and women your age would take freedom rides down south, to work for the civil rights movement.
the same reason that black women would walk instead of ride a bus after a long day of doing somebody else’s laundry and cleaning somebody else’s kitchen.
because they were marching for freedom.
today, on this day of possibility, we stand in the shadow of a lanky, raw-boned man with little formal education who once took the stage at old main and told the nation that if anyone did not believe the american principles of freedom and equality, that those principles were timeless and all-inclusive, they should go rip that page out of the declaration of independence.
my hope for all of you is that as you leave here today, you decide to keep these principles alive in your own life and in the life of this country.
you will be tested.
you won’t always succeed.
but know that you have it within your power to try.
that generations who have come before you faced these same fears and uncertainties in their own time.
and that through our collective labor, and through god’s providence, and our willingness to shoulder each other’s burdens, america will continue on its precious journey towards that distant horizon, and a better day.
thank you so much class of 2005, and congratulations on your graduation.
thank you.
senator obama: thank you very much, mr. president; ladies and gentlemen of the senate:
i have to say that i didn't anticipate speaking today, but
the importance, i think, of this issue is one in which i feel it's important for me to address this body.
you know, during the election i had the occasion of meeting a woman who had supported me in my campaign.
and she decided to come to shake my hand and take a photograph.
a wonderful woman, she wasn't asking for anything, and i was very grateful that she took time to come by.
it was a[n]
unexceptional moment except for the fact that she was born in 1894.
and her name was marguerite lewis, an african-american woman who had been born in louisiana, born in the shadow of slavery, born at a time when lynchings were commonplace, born at a time when african-americans and women could not vote.
and yet, over the course of decades she had participated in broadening our democracy and ensuring that, in fact, at some point, if not herself, then her children and her grandchildren and her great-grandchildren would be in a position in which they could, too, call themselves citizens of the united states and make certain that this government works not just on behalf of the mighty and the powerful but also on behalf of people like her.
and so the fact that she voted and that her vote was counted in this election was of supreme importance to her
and it is the memory of talking to her and shaking her hand that causes me to rise on this occasion.
i am absolutely convinced that the president of the united states, george bush, won this election.
i also believe that he got more votes in ohio.
i think, as has already been said by some of the speakers in this body, he is not some -- this is not an issue in which we are challenging the outcome of the election.
and i think it's important for us to separate out the issue of the election outcome with the election process.
i was not in this body four years ago, but what i observed as a voter, as a citizen of illinois four years ago, were troubling evidence of the fact that not every vote was being counted.
and i think that it is unfortunate four years later that we continue to see circumstances in which people who believe that they have the right to vote -- who show up at the polls -- still continue to confront the sort of problems that have been documented as taking place, not just in ohio, but [in] places all across the country.
i would strongly urge that this chamber, as well as the house of representatives, take it upon itself once and for all to reform this system.
there is no reason, at a time when we have enormous battles taking place ideologically all across the globe, at a time when we're try to make certain that we encourage democracy in iraq and afghanistan and other places throughout the world, that we have the legitimacy of our elections challenged, rightly or wrongly, by people who are not certain as to whether our processes are fair and just.
this is something that we can fix.
we have experts on both sides of the aisle who know how to fix it.
what we've lacked is the political will.
i would strongly urge that, in a circumstance in which too many voters have stood in long lines for hours, in which too many voters have cast votes on machines that jam or malfunction or suck the votes without a trace, in which too many voters try to register to vote only to discover that their names don't appear on the roles, or that partisan political interests and those that serve them have worked hard to throw up every barrier to recognize them as lawful, in which too many voters will know that there are different elections for different parts of the country and that these differences turn shamefully on differences of wealth or of race, in which too many voters have to contend with state officials, servants of the public, who put partisan or personal political interests ahead of the public in administering our elections -- in such circumstances, we have an obligation to fix the problem.
and i have to add that this is not a problem unique to this election, and it is not a partisan problem.
keep in mind, i come from cook county, from chicago, in which there is a long record of these kinds of problems taking place and disadvantaging republicans as well as democrats.
so i would ask that all of us rise up and use this occasion --
senate president:
senator's time has expired.
senator obama: -- to amend this problem.
thank you.
thank you so much.
thank you.
thank you.
thank you so much.
thank you so much.
thank you.
thank you.
thank you, dick durbin.
you make us all proud.
on behalf of the great state of illinois, crossroads of a nation, land of lincoln, let me express my deepest gratitude for the privilege of addressing this convention.
tonight is a particular honor for me because, let’s face it, my presence on this stage is pretty unlikely.
my father was a foreign student, born and raised in a small village in kenya.
he grew up herding goats, went to school in a tin-roof shack.
his father -- my grandfather -- was a cook, a domestic servant to the british.
but my grandfather had larger dreams for his son.
through hard work and perseverance my father got a scholarship to study in a magical place, america, that shone as a beacon of freedom and opportunity to so many who had come before.
while studying here, my father met my mother.
she was born in a town on the other side of the world, in kansas.
her father worked on oil rigs and farms through most of the depression.
the day after pearl harbor my grandfather signed up for duty; joined patton’s army, marched across europe.
back home, my grandmother raised a baby and went to work on a bomber assembly line.
after the war, they studied on the g.i. bill, bought a house through f.h.a., and later moved west all the way to hawaii in search of opportunity.
and they, too, had big dreams for their daughter.
a common dream, born of two continents.
my parents shared not only an improbable love, they shared an abiding faith in the possibilities of this nation.
they would give me an african name, barack, or ”blessed,” believing that in a tolerant america your name is no barrier to success.
they imagined -- they imagined me going to the best schools in the land, even though they weren’t rich, because in a generous america you don’t have to be rich to achieve your potential.
they're both passed away now.
and yet, i know that on this night they look down on me with great pride.
they stand here -- and i stand here today, grateful for the diversity of my heritage, aware that my parents’ dreams live on in my two precious daughters.
i stand here knowing that my story is part of the larger american story
, that i owe a debt to all of those who came before me, and that, in no other country on earth, is my story even possible.
tonight, we gather to affirm the greatness of our nation -- not because of the height of our skyscrapers, or the power of our military, or the size of our economy.
our pride is based on a very simple premise, summed up in a declaration made over two hundred years ago:

we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
that is the true genius of america, a faith -- a faith in simple dreams, an insistence on small miracles; that we can tuck in our children at night and know that they are fed and clothed and safe from harm; that we can say what we think, write what we think, without hearing a sudden knock on the door; that we can have an idea and start our own business without paying a bribe; that we can participate in the political process without fear of retribution, and that our votes will be counted -- at least most of the time.
this year, in this election we are called to reaffirm our values and our commitments, to hold them against a hard reality and see how we're measuring up to the legacy of our forbearers and the promise of future generations.
and fellow americans, democrats, republicans, independents
, i say to you tonight:
we have more work to do --  more work to do for the workers i met in galesburg, illinois, who are losing their union jobs at the maytag plant that’s moving to mexico, and now are having to compete with their own children for jobs that pay seven bucks an hour; more to do for the father that i met who was losing his job and choking back the tears, wondering how he would pay 4500 dollars a month for the drugs his son needs without the health benefits that he counted on; more to do for the young woman in east st. louis, and thousands more like her, who has the grades, has the drive, has the will, but doesn’t have the money to go to college.
now, don’t get me wrong.
the people i meet -- in small towns and big cities, in diners and office parks -- they don’t expect government to solve all their problems.
they know they have to work hard to get ahead,
and they want to.
go into the collar counties around chicago, and people will tell you they don’t want their tax money wasted, by a welfare agency or by the pentagon.
go in -- go into any inner city neighborhood, and folks will tell you that government alone can’t teach our kids to learn; they know that parents have to teach, that children can’t achieve unless we raise their expectations and turn off the television sets and eradicate the slander that says a black youth with a book is acting white.
they know those things.
people don’t expect -- people don't expect government to solve all their problems.
but they sense, deep in their bones, that with just a slight change in priorities, we can make sure that every child in america has a decent shot at life, and that the doors of opportunity remain open to all.
they know we can do better.
and they want that choice.
in this election, we offer that choice.
our party has chosen a man to lead us who embodies the best this country has to offer.
and that man is john kerry.
john kerry understands the ideals of community, faith, and service because they’ve defined his life.
from his heroic service to vietnam, to his years as a prosecutor and lieutenant governor, through two decades in the united states senate, he's devoted himself to this country.
again and again, we’ve seen him make tough choices when easier ones were available.
his values and his record affirm
what is best in us.
john kerry believes in an america where hard work is rewarded; so instead of offering tax breaks to companies shipping jobs overseas, he offers them to companies creating jobs here at home.
john kerry believes in an america where all americans can afford the same health coverage our politicians in washington have for themselves.
john kerry believes in energy independence, so we aren’t held hostage to the profits of oil companies, or the sabotage of foreign oil fields.
john kerry believes in the constitutional freedoms that have made our country the envy of the world, and he will never sacrifice our basic liberties, nor use faith as a wedge to divide us.
and john kerry believes that in a dangerous world war must be an option sometimes, but it should never be the first option.
you know, a while back -- awhile back i met a young man named shamus in a v.f.w. hall in east moline, illinois.
he was a good-looking kid -- six two, six three, clear eyed, with an easy smile.
he told me he’d joined the marines and was heading to iraq the following week.
and as i listened to him explain why he’d enlisted, the absolute faith he had in our country and its leaders, his devotion to duty and service
, i thought this young man was all that any of us might ever hope for in a child.
but then i asked myself, "are we serving shamus as well as he is serving us?"
i thought of the 900 men and women -- sons and daughters, husbands and wives, friends and neighbors, who won’t be returning to their own hometowns.
i thought of the families i’ve met who were struggling to get by without a loved one’s full income, or
whose loved ones had returned with a limb missing or nerves shattered, but still lacked long-term health benefits because they were reservists.
when we send our young men and women into harm’s way, we have a solemn obligation not to fudge the numbers or shade the truth about why they’re going, to care for their families while they’re gone, to tend to the soldiers upon their return, and to never ever go to war without enough troops to win the war, secure the peace, and earn the respect of the world.
now -- now let me be clear.
let me be clear.
we have real enemies in the world.
these enemies must be found.
they must be pursued.
and they must be defeated.
john kerry knows this.
and just as lieutenant kerry did not hesitate to risk his life to protect the men who served with him in vietnam, president kerry will not hesitate one moment to use our military might to keep america safe and secure.
john kerry believes in america.
and he knows that it’s not enough for just some of us to prosper -- for alongside our famous individualism, there’s another ingredient in the american saga,  a belief that we’re all connected as one people.
if there is a child on the south side of chicago who can’t read, that matters to me, even if it’s not my child.
if there is a senior citizen somewhere who can’t pay for their prescription drugs, and having to choose between medicine and the rent, that makes my life poorer, even if it’s not my grandparent.
if there’s an arab american family being rounded up without benefit of an attorney or due process, that threatens my civil liberties.
it is that fundamental belief
-- it is that fundamental belief: i am my brother’s keeper.
i am my sister’s keeper that makes this country work.
it’s
what allows us to pursue our individual dreams and yet still come together as one american family.
e pluribus unum:
"out of many, one."
now even as we speak, there are those who are preparing to divide us -- the spin masters, the negative ad peddlers who embrace the politics of "anything goes.
"
well, i say to them tonight, there is not a liberal america and a conservative america -- there is the united states of america.
there is not a black america and a white america and latino america and asian america -- there’s the united states of america.
the pundits, the pundits like to slice-and-dice our country into red states and blue states; red states for republicans, blue states for democrats.
but i’ve got news for them, too.
we worship an "awesome god" in the blue states, and we don’t like federal agents poking around in our libraries in the red states.
we coach little league in the blue states and yes, we’ve got some gay friends in the red states.
there are patriots who opposed the war in iraq and there are patriots who supported the war in iraq.
we are one people, all of us pledging allegiance to the stars and stripes, all of us defending the united states of america.
in the end -- in the end -- in the end, that’s what this election is about.
do we participate in a politics of cynicism or do we participate in a politics of hope?
john kerry calls on us to hope.
john edwards calls on us to hope.
i’m not talking about blind optimism here -- the almost willful ignorance that thinks unemployment will go away if we just don’t think about it, or the health care crisis will solve itself if we just ignore it.
that’s not what i’m talking about.
i’m talking about something more substantial.
it’s the hope of slaves sitting around a fire singing freedom songs; the hope of immigrants setting out for distant shores; the hope of a young naval lieutenant bravely patrolling the mekong delta; the hope of a millworker’s son who dares to defy the odds; the hope of a skinny kid with a funny name who believes that america has a place for him, too.
hope --
hope in the face of difficulty.
hope in the face of uncertainty.
the audacity of hope!
in the end, that is god’s greatest gift to us, the bedrock of this nation.
a belief in things not seen.
a belief that there are better days ahead.
i believe that we can give our middle class relief and provide working families with a road to opportunity.
i believe we can provide jobs to the jobless, homes to the homeless, and reclaim young people in cities across america from violence and despair.
i believe that we have a righteous wind at our backs and that as we stand on the crossroads of history, we can make the right choices, and meet the challenges that face us.
america!
tonight, if you feel the same energy that i do, if you feel the same urgency that i do, if you feel the same passion that i do, if you feel the same hopefulness that i do -- if we do what we must do, then i have no doubt that all across the country, from florida to oregon, from washington to maine, the people will rise up in november, and john kerry will be sworn in as president, and john edwards will be sworn in as vice president, and this country will reclaim its promise, and out of this long political darkness a brighter day will come.
thank you very much everybody.
god bless you.
thank you.
mr. vice president, madam speaker, mr. prime minister, members of lok sabha and rajya sabha, and most of all, the people of india.
i thank you for the great honor of addressing the representatives of more than one billion indians and the world’s largest democracy.
i bring the greetings and friendship of the world
’s oldest democracy -- the united states of america, including nearly three million proud and patriotic indian-americans.
over the past three days, my wife michelle and i have experienced the -- and dynamism of india and its people -- from the majesty of humayun’s tomb to the advanced technologies that are empowering farmers and women who are the backbone of indian society; from the diwali celebrations with schoolchildren to the innovators who are fueling india’s economic rise; from the university students who will chart india’s future, to you -- leaders who helped to bring india to this moment of extraordinary promise.
at every stop, we have been welcomed with the hospitality for which indians have always been known.
so, to you and the people of india, on behalf of me, michelle and the american people, please accept my deepest thanks.
bahoot dhanyavad.
now, i am not the first american president to visit india.
nor will i be the last.
but i am proud to visit india so early in my presidency.
it’s
no coincidence that india is my first stop on a visit to asia, or that this has been my longest visit to another country since becoming president.
for in asia and around the world, india is not simply emerging; india has emerged.
and it is my firm belief that the relationship between the united states and india -- bound by our shared interests and our shared values -- will be one of the defining partnerships of the 21st century.
this is the partnership i’ve come here to build.
this is the vision that our nations can realize together.
my confidence in our shared future is grounded in my respect for india’s treasured past -- a civilization that’s been shaping the world for thousands of years.
indians unlocked the intricacies of the human body and the vastness of our universe.
it’s no exaggeration to say that our information age is rooted in indian innovations -- including the number zero.
of course, india not only opened our minds, she expanded our moral imaginations -- with religious texts that still summon the faithful to lives of dignity and discipline, with poets who imagined a future “where the mind is without fear and the head is held high” -- and with a man whose message of love and justice endures -- the father of your nation, mahatma gandhi.
for me and michelle, this visit has, therefore, held special meaning.
see, throughout my life, including my work as a young man on behalf of the urban poor
, i’ve always found inspiration in the life of gandhiji and his simple and profound lesson to be the change we seek in the world.
and just as he summoned indians to seek their destiny, he influenced champions of equality in my own country, including a young preacher named martin luther king.
after making his pilgrimage to india a half-century ago, dr. king called gandhi’s philosophy of non-violent resistance “the only logical and moral approach” in the struggle for justice and progress.
so we were honored to visit the residence where gandhi and king both stayed -- mani bhavan.
and we were humbled to pay our respects at raj ghat.
and i am mindful that i might not be standing before you today, as president of the united states
, had it not been for gandhi and the message he shared and inspired  with america and the world.
an ancient civilization of science and innovation
; a fundamental faith in human progress -- this is the sturdy foundation upon which you have built ever since that stroke of midnight when the tricolor was raised over a free and independent india.
and despite the skeptics who said this country was simply too poor, or too vast, or too diverse to succeed, you surmounted overwhelming odds and became a model to the world.
instead of slipping into starvation, you launched a green revolution that fed millions.
instead of becoming dependent on commodities and exports, you invested in science and technology and in your greatest resource -- the indian people.
and the world sees the results, from the supercomputers you build to the indian flag that you put on the moon.
instead of resisting the global economy, you became one of its engines -- reforming the licensing raj and unleashing an economic marvel that has lifted tens of millions of people from poverty and created one of the world’s largest middle classes.
instead of succumbing to division, you have shown that the strength of india -- the very idea of india -- is its embrace of all colors, all castes, all creeds.
it’s
the diversity represented in this chamber today.
it’s
the richness of faiths celebrated by a visitor to my hometown of chicago more than a century ago -- the renowned swami vivekananda.
he said that, “holiness, purity and charity are not the exclusive possessions of any church in the world, and that every system has produced men and women of the most exalted character.”
and instead of being lured by the false notion that progress must come at the expense of freedom, you built the institutions upon which true democracy depends -- free and fair elections, which enable citizens to choose their own leaders without recourse to arms -- an independent judiciary and the rule of law, which allows people to address their grievances; and a thriving free press and vibrant civil society which allows every voice to be heard.
this year, as india marks 60 years with a strong and democratic constitution, the lesson is clear:  india has succeeded, not in spite of democracy; india has succeeded because of democracy.
now, just as india has changed, so, too, has the relationship between our two nations.
in the decades after independence, india advanced its interests as a proud leader of the nonaligned movement.
yet, too often, the united states and india found ourselves on opposite sides of a north-`south divide, estranged by a long cold war.
those days are over.
here in india, two successive governments led by different parties have recognized that deeper partnership with america is both natural and necessary.
and in the united states, both of my predecessors -- one a democrat, one a republican -- worked to bring us closer, leading to increased trade and a landmark civil nuclear agreement.
so since that time, people in both our countries have asked: what’s next?
how can we build on this progress and realize the full potential of our partnership?
that’s
what i want to address today --
the future that the united states seeks in an interconnected world, and why i believe that india is indispensable to this vision
; how we can forge a truly global partnership -- not just in one or two areas, but across many; not just for our mutual benefit, but for the benefit of the world.
of course, only indians can determine india’s national interests and how to advance them on the world stage.
but i stand before you today because i am convinced that the interests of the united states -- and the interests we share with india -- are best advanced in partnership.
i believe that.
the united states seeks security -- the security of our country, our allies and partners.
we seek prosperity -- a strong and growing economy in an open international economic system.
we seek respect for universal values.
and we seek a just and sustainable international order that promotes peace and security by meeting global challenges through stronger global cooperation.
now, to advance these interests, i have committed the united states to comprehensive engagement with the world, based on mutual interest and mutual respect.
and a central pillar of this engagement is forging deeper cooperation with 21st century centers of influence -- and that must necessarily include india.
now, india is not the only emerging power in the world.
but relationships between our countries is unique.
for we are two strong democracies whose constitutions begin with the same revolutionary words -- the same revolutionary words -- “we the people.”
we are two great republics dedicated to the liberty and justice and equality of all people.
and we are two free market economies where people have the freedom to pursue ideas and innovation that can change the world.
and that’s why i believe that india and america are indispensable partners in meeting the challenges of our time.
since taking office, i’ve, therefore, made our relationship a priority.
i was proud to welcome prime minister singh for the first official state visit of my presidency.
for the first time ever, our governments are working together across the whole range of common challenges that we face.
now, let me say it as clearly as i can:
the united states not only welcomes india as a rising global power, we fervently support it, and we have worked to help make it a reality.
together with our partners, we have made the g20 the premier forum for international economic cooperation, bringing more voices to the table of global economic decision-making, and that has included india.
we’ve increased the role of emerging economies like india at international financial institutions.
we valued india’s important role at copenhagen, where, for the first time, all major economies committed to take action to confront climate change -- and to stand by those actions.
we salute india’s long history as a leading contributor to united nations peacekeeping missions.
and we welcome india as it prepares to take its seat on the united nations security council.
in short, with india assuming its rightful place in the world, we have an historic opportunity to make the relationship between our two countries a defining partnership of the century ahead.
and i believe we can do so by working together in three important areas.
first, as global partners we can promote prosperity in both our countries.
together, we can create the high-tech, high-wage jobs of the future.
with my visit, we are now ready to begin implementing our civil nuclear agreement.
this will help meet india’s growing energy needs and create thousands of jobs in both of our countries.
we need to forge partnerships in high-tech sectors like defense and civil space.
so we’ve removed indian organizations from our so-called “entity list.”
and we’ll work to remove -- and reform our controls on exports.
both of these steps will ensure that indian companies seeking high-tech trade and technologies from america are treated the same as our very closest allies and partners.
we can pursue joint research and development to create green jobs; give india more access to cleaner, affordable energy; meet the commitments we made at copenhagen; and show the possibilities of low-carbon growth.
and together, we can resist the protectionism that stifles growth and innovation.
the united states remains -- and will continue to remain -- one of the most open economies in the world.
and by opening markets and reducing barriers to foreign investment, india can realize its full economic potential as well.
as g20 partners, we can make sure the global economic recovery is strong and is durable.
and we can keep striving for a doha round that is ambitious and is balanced -- with the courage to make the compromises that are necessary so global trade works for all economies.
together, we can strengthen agriculture.
cooperation between indian and american researchers and scientists sparked the green revolution.
today, india is a leader in using technology to empower farmers, like those i met yesterday who get free updates on market and weather conditions on their cell phones.
and the united states is a leader in agricultural productivity and research.
now, as farmers and rural areas face the effects of climate change and drought, we’ll work together to spark a second, more sustainable evergreen revolution.
together, we’re improving indian weather forecasting systems before the next monsoon season.
we aim to help millions of indian farmers -- farming households save water and increase productivity, improve food processing so crops don’t spoil on the way to market, and enhance climate and crop forecasting to avoid losses that cripple communities and drive up food prices.
and as part of our food security initiative, we’re going to share india
’s expertise with farmers in africa.
and this is an indication of india’s rise -- that we can now export hard-earned expertise to countries that see india as a model for agricultural development.
it’s another powerful example of how american and indian partnership can address an urgent global challenge.
because the wealth of a nation also depends on the health of its people, we’ll continue to support india
’s effort against diseases like tuberculosis and hiv/aids, and as global partners, we’ll work to improve global health by preventing the spread of pandemic flu.
and because knowledge is the currency of the 21st century, we will increase exchanges between our students, our colleges and our universities, which are among the best in the world.
as we work to advance our shared prosperity, we can partner to address a second priority -- and that is our shared security.
in mumbai, i met with the courageous families and survivors of that barbaric attack.
and here in parliament, which was itself targeted because of the democracy it represents, we honor the memory of all those who have been taken from us, including american citizens on 26/11 and indian citizens on 9/11.
this is the bond that we share.
it
’s why we insist that nothing ever justifies the slaughter of innocent men, women and children.
it
’s why we’re working together, more closely than ever, to prevent terrorist attacks and to deepen our cooperation even further.
and it’s why, as strong and resilient societies, we refuse to live in fear.
we will not sacrifice the values and rule of law that defines us, and we will never waver in the defense of our people.
america’s fight against al qaeda and its terrorist affiliates is why we persevere in afghanistan, where major development assistance from india has improved the lives of the afghan people.
we’re making progress in our mission to break the taliban’s momentum and to train afghan forces so they can take the lead for their security.
and while i have made it clear that american forces will begin the transition to afghan responsibility next summer, i’ve also made it clear that america
’s commitment to the afghan people will endure.
the united states will not abandon the people of afghanistan -- or the region -- to violent extremists who threaten us all.
our strategy to disrupt and dismantle and defeat al qaeda and its affiliates has to succeed on both sides of the border.
and that’s why we have worked with the pakistani government to address the threat of terrorist networks in the border region.
the pakistani government increasingly recognizes that these networks are not just a threat outside of pakistan -- they are a threat to the pakistani people, as well.
they’ve suffered greatly at the hands of violent extremists over the last several years.
and we’ll continue to insist to pakistan's leaders that terrorist safe havens within their borders are unacceptable, and that terrorists behind the mumbai attacks must be brought to justice.
we must also recognize that all of us have an interest in both an afghanistan and a pakistan that is stable and prosperous and democratic -- and india has an interest in that, as well.
in pursuit of regional security, we will continue to welcome dialogue between india and pakistan, even as we recognize that disputes between your two countries can only be resolved by the people of your two countries.
more broadly, india and the united states can partner in asia.
today, the united states is once again playing a leadership role in asia -- strengthening old alliances; deepening relationships, as we are doing with china; and we’re reengaging with regional organizations like asean and joining the east asia summit -- organizations in which india is also a partner.
like your neighbors in southeast asia, we want india not only to “look east,” we want india to “engage east” -- because it will increase the security and prosperity of all our nations.
as two global leaders, the united states and india can partner for global security -- especially as india serves on the security council over the next two years.
indeed, the just and sustainable international order that america seeks includes a united nations that is efficient, effective, credible and legitimate.
that is why i can say today,
in the years ahead, i look forward to a reformed united nations security council that includes india as a permanent member.
now, let me suggest that with increased power comes increased responsibility.
the united nations exists to fulfill its founding ideals of preserving peace and security, promoting global cooperation, and advancing human rights.
these are the responsibilities of all nations, but especially those that seek to lead in the 21st century.
and so we look forward to working with india -- and other nations that aspire to security council membership -- to ensure that the security council is effective; that resolutions are implemented, that sanctions are enforced; that we strengthen the international norms which recognize the rights and responsibilities of all nations and all individuals.
this includes our responsibility to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons.
since i took office, the united states has reduced the role of nuclear weapons in our national security strategy, and we've agreed with russia to reduce our own arsenals.
we have put preventing nuclear proliferation and nuclear terrorism at the top of our nuclear agenda, and we have strengthened the cornerstone of the global non-proliferation regime, which is the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.
together, the united states and india can pursue our goal of securing the world’s vulnerable nuclear materials.
we can make it clear that even as every nation has the right to peaceful nuclear energy, every nation must also meet its international obligations -- and that includes the islamic republic of iran.
and together, we can pursue a vision that indian leaders have espoused since independence -- a world without nuclear weapons.
and this leads me to the final area where our countries can partner -- strengthening the foundations of democratic governance, not only at home but abroad.
in the united states, my administration has worked to make government more open and transparent and accountable to people.
here in india, you’re harnessing technologies to do the same, as i saw yesterday at an expo in mumbai.
your landmark right to information act is empowering citizens with the ability to get the services to which they’re entitled -- and to hold officials accountable.
voters can get information about candidates by text message.
and you’re delivering education and health care services to rural communities, as i saw yesterday when i joined an e-panchayat with villagers in rajasthan.
now, in a new collaboration on open government, our two countries are going to share our experience, identify what works, and develop the next generation of tools to empower citizens.
and in another example of how american and indian partnership can address global challenges, we’re going to share these innovations with civil society groups and countries around the world.
we’re going to show that democracy, more than any other form of government, delivers for the common man -- and woman.
likewise, when indians vote, the whole world watches.
thousands of political parties; hundreds of thousands of polling centers; millions of candidates and poll workers -- and 700 million voters.
there’s nothing like it on the planet.
there is so much that countries transitioning to democracy could learn from india’s experience, so much expertise that india can share with the world.
and that, too, is what is possible when the world’s largest democracy embraces its role as a global leader.
as the world’s two largest democracies, we must never forget that the price of our own freedom is standing up for the freedom of others.
indians know this, for it is the story of your nation.
before he ever began his struggle for indian independence, gandhi stood up for the rights of indians in south africa.
just as others, including the united states, supported indian independence, india championed the self-determination of peoples from africa to asia as they, too, broke free from colonialism.
and along with the united states, you’ve been a leader in supporting democratic development and civil society groups around the world.
and this, too, is part of india’s greatness.
now, we all understand every country will follow its own path.
no one nation has a monopoly on wisdom, and no nation should ever try to impose its values on another.
but when peaceful democratic movements are suppressed -- as they have been in burma, for example -- then the democracies of the world cannot remain silent.
for it is unacceptable to gun down peaceful protestors and incarcerate political prisoners
decade after decade.
it is unacceptable to hold the aspirations of an entire people hostage to the greed and paranoia of bankrupt regimes.
it is unacceptable to steal elections, as the regime in burma has done again for all the world to see.
faced with such gross violations of human rights, it is the responsibility of the international community -- especially leaders like the united states and india -- to condemn it.
and if i can be frank, in international fora, india has often shied away from some of these issues.
but speaking up for those who cannot do so for themselves is not interfering in the affairs of other countries.
it’s not violating the rights of sovereign nations.
it is staying true to our democratic principles.
it is giving meaning to the human rights that we say are universal.
and it sustains the progress that in asia and around the world has helped turn dictatorships into democracies and ultimately increased our security in the world.
so promoting shared prosperity, preserving peace and security, strengthening democratic governance and human rights -- these are the responsibilities of leadership.
and as global partners, this is the leadership that the united states and india can offer in the 21st century.
ultimately, though, this cannot be a relationship only between presidents and prime ministers, or in the halls of this parliament.
ultimately, this must be a partnership between our peoples.
so i want to conclude by speaking directly to the people of india who are watching today.
in your lives, you have overcome odds that might have overwhelmed a lesser country.
in just decades, you have achieved progress and development that took other nations centuries.
you are now assuming your rightful place as a leader among nations.
your parents and grandparents imagined this.
your children and grandchildren will look back on this.
but only this generation of indians can seize the possibilities of the moment.
as you carry on with the hard work ahead, i want every indian citizen to know:  the united states of america will not simply be cheering you on from the sidelines.
we will be right there with you, shoulder to shoulder.
because we believe in the promise of india.
we believe that the future is what we make it.
we believe that no matter who you are or where you come from, every person can fulfill their god-given potential, just as a dalit like dr. ambedkar could lift himself up and pen the words of the constitution that protects the rights of all indians.
we believe that no matter where you live -- whether a village in punjab or the bylanes of chandni chowk -- an old section of kolkata or a new high-rise in bangalore -- every person deserves the same chance to live in security and dignity, to get an education, to find work, to give their children a better future.
and we believe that when countries and cultures put aside old habits and attitudes that keep people apart, when we recognize our common humanity, then we can begin to fulfill these aspirations that we share.
it’s a simple lesson contained in that collection of stories which has guided indians for centuries -- the panchtantra.
and it’s the spirit of the inscription seen by all who enter this great hall:
“that one is mine and the other
a stranger is the concept of little minds.
but to the large-hearted, the world itself is their family.”
this is the story of india; this is the story of america -- that despite their differences, people can see themselves in one another, and work together and succeed together as one proud nation.
and it can be the spirit of partnership between our nations --
that even as we honor the histories which in different times kept us apart, even as we preserve what makes us unique in a globalized world, we can recognize how much we can achieve together.
and if we let this simple concept be our guide, if we pursue the vision i’ve described today -- a global partnership to meet global challenges -- then i have no doubt that future generations -- indians and americans -- will live in a world that is more prosperous and more secure and more just because of the bonds that our generation has forged today.
so, thank you, and jai hind.  and long live the partnership between india and the united states.
mr. president, mr. secretary-general, my fellow delegates, ladies and gentlemen.
it is a great honor to address this assembly for the second time, nearly two years after my election as president of the united states.
we know this is no ordinary time for our people.
each of us comes here with our own problems and priorities.
but there are also challenges that we share in common as leaders and as nations.
we meet within an institution built from the rubble of war, designed to unite the world in pursuit of peace.
and we meet within a city that for centuries has welcomed people from across the globe, demonstrating that individuals of every color, faith and station can come together to pursue opportunity, build a community, and live with the blessing of human liberty.
outside the doors of this hall, the blocks and neighborhoods of this great city tell the story of a difficult decade.
nine years ago, the destruction of the world trade center signaled a threat that respected no boundary of dignity or decency.
two years ago this month, a financial crisis on wall street devastated american families on main street.
these separate challenges have affected people around the globe.
men and women and children have been murdered by extremists from casablanca to london; from jalalabad to jakarta.
the global economy suffered an enormous blow during the financial crisis, crippling markets and deferring the dreams of millions on every continent.
underneath these challenges to our security and prosperity lie deeper fears:
that ancient hatreds and religious divides are once again ascendant; that a world which has grown more interconnected has somehow slipped beyond our control.
these are some of the challenges that my administration has confronted since we came into office.
and today, i’d like to talk to you about what we’ve done over the last 20 months to meet these challenges; what our responsibility is to pursue peace in the middle east; and what kind of world we are trying to build in this 21st century.
let me begin with what we have done.
i have had no greater focus as president than rescuing our economy from potential catastrophe.
and in an age when prosperity is shared, we could not do this alone.
so america has joined with nations around the world to spur growth, and the renewed demand that could restart job creation.
we are reforming our system of global finance, beginning with wall street reform here at home, so that a crisis like this never happens again.
and we made the g20
the focal point for international coordination, because in a world where prosperity is more diffuse, we must broaden our circle of cooperation to include emerging economies -- economies from every corner of the globe.
there is much to show for our efforts, even as there is much work to be done.
the global economy has been pulled back from the brink of a depression, and is growing once more.
we have resisted protectionism, and are exploring ways to expand trade and commerce among nations.
but we cannot -- and will not -- rest until these seeds of progress grow into a broader prosperity, not only for all americans, but for peoples around the globe.
as for our common security, america is waging a more effective fight against al qaeda, while winding down the war in iraq.
since i took office, the united states has removed nearly 100,000 troops from iraq.
we have done so responsibly, as iraqis have transitioned to lead responsibility for the security of their country.
we are now focused on building a lasting partnership with the iraqi people, while keeping our commitment to remove the rest of our troops by the end of next year.
while drawing down in iraq, we have refocused on defeating al qaeda and denying its affiliates a safe haven.
in afghanistan, the united states and our allies are pursuing a strategy to break the taliban’s momentum and build the capacity of afghanistan’s government and security forces, so that a transition to afghan responsibility can begin next july.
and from south asia to the horn of africa, we are moving toward a more targeted approach -- one that strengthens our partners and dismantles terrorist networks without deploying large american armies.
as we pursue the world
’s most dangerous extremists, we’re also denying them the world
’s most dangerous weapons, and pursuing the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons.
earlier this year, 47 nations embraced a work-plan to secure all vulnerable nuclear materials within four years.
we have joined with russia to sign the most comprehensive arms control treaty in decades.
we have reduced the role of nuclear weapons in our security strategy.
and here, at the united nations, we came together to strengthen the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.
as part of our effort on non-proliferation, i offered the islamic republic of iran an extended hand last year, and underscored that it has both rights and responsibilities as a member of the international community.
i also said -- in this hall -- that iran must be held accountable if it failed to meet those responsibilities.
and that is what we have done.
iran is the only party to the npt that cannot demonstrate the peaceful intentions of its nuclear program, and those actions have consequences.
through u.n. security council resolution 1929, we made it clear that international law is not an empty promise.
now let me be clear once more:  the united states and the international community seek a resolution to our differences with iran, and the door remains open to diplomacy should iran choose to walk through it.
but the iranian government must demonstrate a clear and credible commitment and confirm to the world the peaceful intent of its nuclear program.
as we combat the spread of deadly weapons, we’re also confronting the specter of climate change.
after making historic investments in clean energy and efficiency at home, we helped forge an accord in copenhagen that -- for the first time -- commits all major economies to reduce their emissions.
we are keenly aware this is just a first step.
and going forward, we will support a process in which all major economies meet our responsibilities to protect the planet while unleashing the power of clean energy to serve as an engine of growth and development.
america has also embraced unique responsibilities with come -- that come with our power.
since the rains came and the floodwaters rose in pakistan, we have pledged our assistance, and we should all support the pakistani people as they recover and rebuild.
and when the earth shook and haiti was devastated by loss, we joined a coalition of nations in response.
today, we honor those from the u.n. family who lost their lives in the earthquake, and commit ourselves to stand with the people of haiti until they can stand on their own two feet.
amidst this upheaval, we have also been persistent in our pursuit of peace.
last year, i pledged my best efforts to support the goal of two states, israel and palestine, living side by side in peace and security, as part of a comprehensive peace between israel and all of its neighbors.
we have travelled a winding road over the last 12 months, with few peaks and many valleys.
but this month, i am pleased that we have pursued direct negotiations between israelis and palestinians in washington, sharm el sheikh and jerusalem.
now i recognize many are pessimistic about this process.
the cynics say that israelis and palestinians are too distrustful of each other, and too divided internally, to forge lasting peace.
rejectionists on both sides will try to disrupt the process, with bitter words and with bombs and with gunfire.
some say that the gaps between the parties are too big; the potential for talks to break down is too great; and that after decades of failure, peace is simply not possible.
i hear those voices of skepticism.
but i ask you to consider the alternative.
if an agreement is not reached, palestinians will never know the pride and dignity that comes with their own state.
israelis will never know the certainty and security that comes with sovereign and stable neighbors who are committed to coexistence.
the hard realities of demography will take hold.
more blood will be shed.
this holy land will remain a symbol of our differences, instead of our common humanity.
i refuse to accept that future.
and we all have a choice to make.
each of us must choose the path of peace.
of course, that responsibility begins with the parties themselves, who must answer the call of history.
earlier this month at the white house, i was struck by the words of both the israeli and palestinian leaders.
prime minister netanyahu said, “i came here today to find a historic compromise that will enable both people to live in peace, security, and dignity.”  and president abbas said, “we will spare no effort and we will work diligently and tirelessly to ensure these negotiations achieve their cause.”
these words must now be followed by action and i believe that both leaders have the courage to do so.
but the road that they have to travel is exceedingly difficult,
which is why i call upon israelis and palestinians -- and the world -- to rally behind the goal that these leaders now share.
we know that there will be tests along the way and that one test is fast approaching.
israel’s settlement moratorium has made a difference on the ground and improved the atmosphere for talks.
and our position on this issue is well known.
we believe that the moratorium should be extended.
we also believe that talks should press on until completed.
now is the time for the parties to help each other overcome this obstacle.
now is the time to build the trust -- and provide the time -- for substantial progress to be made.
now is the time for this opportunity to be seized, so that it does not slip away.
now, peace must be made by israelis and palestinians, but each of us has a responsibility to do our part as well.
those of us who are friends of israel must understand that true security for the jewish state requires an independent palestine -- one that allows the palestinian people to live with dignity and opportunity.
and those of us who are friends of the palestinians must understand that the rights of the palestinian people will be won only through peaceful means -- including genuine reconciliation with a secure israel.
i know many in this hall count themselves as friends of the palestinians.
but these pledges of friendship must now be supported by deeds.
those who have signed on to the arab peace initiative should seize this opportunity to make it real by taking tangible steps towards the normalization that it promises israel.
and those who speak on behalf of palestinian self-government should help the palestinian authority politically and financially, and in doing so help the palestinians build the institutions of their state.
those who long to see an independent palestine must also stop trying to tear down israel.
after thousands of years, jews and arabs are not strangers in a strange land.
after 60 years in the community of nations, israel’s existence must not be a subject for debate.
israel is a sovereign state, and the historic homeland of the jewish people.
it should be clear to all that efforts to chip away at israel
’s
legitimacy will only be met by the unshakeable opposition of the united states.
and efforts to threaten or kill israelis will do nothing to help the palestinian people.
the slaughter of innocent israelis is not resistance --
it’s injustice.  and make no mistake:  the courage of a man like president abbas, who stands up for his people in front of the world under very difficult circumstances, is far greater than those who fire rockets at innocent women and children.
the conflict between israelis and arabs is as old as this institution.
and we can come back here next year,
as we have for the last 60 years, and make long speeches about it.
we can read familiar lists of grievances.
we can table the same resolutions.
we can further empower the forces of rejectionism and hate.
and we can waste more time by carrying forward an argument that will not help a single israeli or palestinian child achieve a better life.
we can do that.
or, we can say that this time will be different -- that this time we will not let terror, or turbulence, or posturing, or petty politics stand in the way.
this time, we will think not of ourselves, but of the young girl in gaza who wants to have no ceiling on her dreams, or the young boy in sderot who wants to sleep without the nightmare of rocket fire.
this time, we should draw upon the teachings of tolerance that lie at the heart of three great religions that see jerusalem’s soil as sacred.
this time we should reach for what’s best within ourselves.
if we do, when we come back here next year, we can have an agreement that will lead to a new member of the united nations -- an independent, sovereign state of palestine, living in peace with israel.
it is our destiny to bear the burdens of the challenges that i’ve addressed -- recession and war and conflict.
and there is always a sense of urgency -- even emergency --
that drives most of our foreign policies.
indeed, after millennia marked by wars, this very institution reflects the desire of human beings to create a forum to deal with emergencies that will inevitably come.
but even as we confront immediate challenges, we must also summon the foresight to look beyond them, and consider what we are trying to build over the long term?
what is the world that awaits us when today’s battles are brought to an end?
and that is what i would like to talk about with the remainder of my time today.
one of the first actions of this general assembly was to adopt a universal declaration of human rights in 1948.
that declaration begins by stating that, “recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice, and peace in the world.”
the idea is a simple one -- that freedom, justice and peace for the world must begin with freedom, justice, and peace in the lives of individual human beings.
and for the united states, this is a matter of moral and pragmatic necessity.
as robert kennedy said, “the individual man, the child of god, is the touchstone of value, and all society, groups, the state, exist for his benefit.”
so we stand up for universal values because it’s the right thing to do.
but we also know from experience that those who defend these values for their people have been our closest friends and allies, while those who have denied those rights -- whether terrorist groups or tyrannical governments -- have chosen to be our adversaries.
human rights have never gone unchallenged -- not in any of our nations, and not in our world.
tyranny is still with us -- whether it manifests itself in the taliban killing girls who try to go to school, a north korean regime that enslaves its own people, or an armed group in congo-kinshasa that use rape as a weapon of war.
in times of economic unease, there can also be an anxiety about human rights.
today, as in past times of economic downturn, some put human rights aside for the promise of short term stability or the false notion that economic growth can come at the expense of freedom.
we see leaders abolishing term limits.
we see crackdowns on civil society.
we see corruption smothering entrepreneurship and good governance.
we see democratic reforms deferred indefinitely.
as i said last year, each country will pursue a path rooted in the culture of its own people.
yet experience shows us that history is on the side of liberty; that the strongest foundation for human progress lies in open economies, open societies, and open governments.
to put it simply, democracy, more than any other form of government, delivers for our citizens.
and i believe that truth will only grow stronger in a world where the borders between nations are blurred.
america is working to shape a world that fosters this openness, for the rot of a closed or corrupt economy must never eclipse the energy and innovation of human beings.
all of us want the right to educate our children, to make a decent wage, to care for the sick, and to be carried as far as our dreams and our deeds will take us.
but that depends upon economies that tap the power of our people, including the potential of women and girls.
that means letting entrepreneurs start a business without paying a bribe and governments that support opportunity instead of stealing from their people.
and that means rewarding hard work, instead of reckless risk-taking.
yesterday, i put forward a new development policy that will pursue these goals, recognizing that dignity is a human right and global development is in our common interest.
america will partner with nations that offer their people a path out of poverty.
and together, we must unleash growth that powers by individuals and emerging markets in all parts of the globe.
there is no reason why africa should not be an exporter of agriculture, which is why our food security initiative is empowering farmers.
there is no reason why entrepreneurs shouldn’t be able to build new markets in every society, which is why i hosted a summit on entrepreneurship earlier this spring, because the obligation of government is to empower individuals, not to impede them.
the same holds true for civil society.
the arc of human progress has been shaped by individuals with the freedom to assemble and by organizations outside of government that insisted upon democratic change and by free media that held the powerful accountable.
we have seen that from the south africans who stood up to apartheid, to the poles of solidarity, to the mothers of the disappeared who spoke out against the dirty war, to americans who marched for the rights of all races, including my own.
civil society is the conscience of our communities and america will always extend our engagement abroad with citizens beyond the halls of government.
and we will call out those who suppress ideas and serve as a voice for those who are voiceless.
we will promote new tools of communication
so people are empowered to connect with one another and, in repressive societies, to do so with security.
we will support a free and open internet, so individuals have the information to make up their own minds.
and it is time to embrace and effectively monitor norms that advance the rights of civil society and guarantee its expansion within and across borders.
open society supports open government, but it cannot substitute for it.
there is no right more fundamental than the ability to choose your leaders and determine your destiny.
now, make no mistake:  the ultimate success of democracy in the world won’t come because the united states dictates it; it will come because individual citizens demand a say in how they are governed.
there is no soil where this notion cannot take root, just as every democracy reflects the uniqueness of a nation.
later this fall, i will travel to asia.
and i will visit india, which peacefully threw off colonialism and established a thriving democracy of over a billion people.
i’ll continue to indonesia, the world’s largest muslim-majority country, which binds together thousands of islands through the glue of representative government and civil society.
i’ll join the g20 meeting on the korean peninsula, which provides the world
’s clearest contrast between a society that is dynamic and open and free, and one that is imprisoned and closed.
and i will conclude my trip in japan, an ancient culture that found peace and extraordinary development through democracy.
each of these countries gives life to democratic principles in their own way.
and even as some governments roll back reform, we also celebrate the courage of a president in colombia who willingly stepped aside, or the promise of a new constitution in kenya.
the common thread of progress is the principle that government is accountable to its citizens.
and the diversity in this room makes clear
-- no one country has all the answers, but all of us must answer to our own people.
in all parts of the world, we see the promise of innovation to make government more open and accountable.
and now, we must build on that progress.
and when we gather back here next year, we should bring specific commitments to promote transparency; to fight corruption; to energize civic engagement; to leverage new technologies so that we strengthen the foundations of freedom in our own countries, while living up to the ideals that can light the world.
this institution can still play an indispensable role in the advance of human rights.
it’s
time to welcome the efforts of u.n. women to protect the rights of women around the globe.
it’s time for every member state to open its elections to international monitors and increase the u.n. democracy fund.
it’s
time to reinvigorate u.n. peacekeeping, so that missions have the resources necessary to succeed, and so atrocities like sexual violence are prevented and justice is enforced -- because neither dignity nor democracy can thrive without basic security.
and it’s time to make this institution more accountable as well, because the challenges of a new century demand new ways of serving our common interests.
the world that america seeks is not one we can build on our own.
for human rights to reach those who suffer the boot of oppression, we need your voices to speak out.
in particular, i appeal to those nations who emerged from tyranny and inspired the world in the second half of the last century -- from south africa to south asia; from eastern europe to south america.
don’t stand idly by, don’t be silent, when dissidents elsewhere are imprisoned and protesters are beaten.
recall your own history.
because part of the price of our own freedom is standing up for the freedom of others.
that belief will guide america’s leadership in this 21st century.
it is a belief that has seen us through more than two centuries of trial, and it will see us through the challenges we face today -- be it war or recession; conflict or division.
so even as we have come through a difficult decade, i stand here before you confident in the future -- a future where iraq is governed by neither tyrant nor a foreign power, and afghanistan is freed from the turmoil of war; a future where the children of israel and palestine can build the peace that was not possible for their parents; a world where the promise of development reaches into the prisons of poverty and disease; a future where the cloud of recession gives way to the light of renewal and the dream of opportunity is available to all.
this future will not be easy to reach.
it will not come without setbacks, nor will it be quickly claimed.
but the founding of the united nations itself is a testament to human progress.
remember, in times that were far more trying than our own, our predecessors chose the hope of unity over the ease of division and made a promise to future generations that the dignity and equality of human beings would be our common cause.
it falls to us to fulfill that promise.
and though we will be met by dark forces that will test our resolve, americans have always had cause to believe that we can choose a better history; that we need only to look outside the walls around us.
for through the citizens of every conceivable ancestry who make this city their own, we see living proof that opportunity can be accessed by all, that what unites us as human beings is far greater than what divides us, and that people from every part of this world can live together in peace.
thank you very much.
secretary gates, admiral mullen and members of the armed forces, my fellow americans;   most of all, to you -- survivors who still carry the scars of tragedy and destruction; to the families who carry in your hearts the memory of the loved ones you lost here: 

for our nation, this is a day of remembrance, a day of reflection, and -- with god’s grace -- a day of unity and renewal.
we gather to remember, at this sacred hour, on hallowed ground -- at places where we feel such grief and where our healing goes on.
we gather here, at the pentagon, where the names of the lost are forever etched in stone.
we gather in a gentle pennsylvania field, where a plane went down and a “tower of voices” will rise and echo through the ages.
and we gather where the twin towers fell, a site where the work goes on so that next year, on the 10th anniversary, the waters will flow in steady tribute to the nearly 3,000 innocent lives.
on this day, it’s perhaps natural to focus on the images of that awful morning -- images that are seared into our souls.
it’s tempting to dwell on the final moments of the loved ones whose lives were taken so cruelly.
yet these memorials, and your presence today, remind us to remember the fullness of their time on earth.
they were fathers and mothers, raising their families; brothers and sisters, pursuing their dreams; sons and daughters, their whole lives before them.
they were civilians and service members.
some never saw the danger coming; others saw the peril and rushed to save others -- up those stairwells, into the flames, into the cockpit.
they were white and black and brown -- men and women and some children made up of all races, many faiths.
they were americans and people from far corners of the world.
and they were snatched from us senselessly and much too soon -- but they lived well, and they live on in you.
nine years have now passed.
in that time, you have shed more tears than we will ever know.
and though it must seem some days as though the world has moved on to other things, i say to you today that your loved ones endure in the heart of our nation, now and forever.
our remembrance today also requires a certain reflection.
as a nation, and as individuals, we must ask ourselves how best to honor them -- those who died, those who sacrificed.
how do we preserve their legacy -- not just on this day, but
every day?
we need not look far for our answer.
the perpetrators of this evil act didn’t simply attack america; they attacked the very idea of america itself -- all that we stand for and represent in the world.
and so the highest honor
we can pay those we lost, indeed our greatest weapon in this ongoing war, is to do what our adversaries fear the most -- to stay true to who we are, as americans; to renew our sense of common purpose; to say that we define the character of our country, and we will not let the acts of some small band of murderers who slaughter the innocent and cower in caves distort who we are.
they doubted our will, but as americans we persevere.
today, in afghanistan and beyond, we have gone on the offensive and struck major blows against al qaeda and its allies.
we will do what is necessary to protect our country, and we honor all those who serve to keep us safe.
they may seek to strike fear in us, but they are no match for our resilience.
we do not succumb to fear, nor will we squander the optimism that has always defined us as a people.
on a day when others sought to destroy, we have chosen to build, with a national day of service and remembrance that summons the inherent goodness of the american people.
they may seek to exploit our freedoms, but we will not sacrifice the liberties we cherish or hunker down behind walls of suspicion and mistrust.
they may wish to drive us apart, but we will not give in to their hatred and prejudice.
for scripture teaches us to “get rid of all bitterness, rage and anger, brawling and slander, along with every form of malice.”
they may seek to spark conflict between different faiths, but as americans we are not -- and never will be -- at war with islam.
it was not a religion that attacked us that september day -- it was al qaeda, a sorry band of men which perverts religion.
and just as we condemn intolerance and extremism abroad, so will we stay true to our traditions here at home as a diverse and tolerant nation.
we champion the rights of every american, including the right to worship as one chooses -- as service members and civilians from many faiths do just steps from here, at the very spot where the terrorists struck this building.
those who attacked us sought to demoralize us, divide us, to deprive us of the very unity, the very ideals, that make america america -- those qualities that have made us a beacon of freedom and hope to billions around the world.
today we declare once more we will never hand them that victory.
as americans, we will keep alive the virtues and values that make us who we are and who we must always be.
for our cause is just.
our spirit is strong.
our resolve is unwavering.
like generations before us, let us come together today and all days to affirm certain inalienable rights, to affirm life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
on this day
and the days to come, we choose to stay true to our best selves -- as one nation, under god, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
this is how we choose to honor the fallen -- your families, your friends, your fellow service members.
this is how we will keep alive the legacy of these proud and patriotic americans.
this is how we will prevail in this great test of our time.
this is how we will preserve and protect the country that we love and pass it -- safer and stronger -- to future generations.
may god bless you and your families, and may god continue to bless the united states of america.
good evening.
tonight, i’d like to talk to you about the end of our combat mission in iraq, the ongoing security challenges we face, and the need to rebuild our nation here at home.
i know this historic moment comes at a time of great uncertainty for many americans.
we’ve now been through nearly a decade of war.
we’ve endured a long and painful recession.
and sometimes in the midst of these storms, the future that we’re trying to build for our nation -- a future of lasting peace and long-term prosperity -- may seem beyond our reach.
but this milestone should serve as a reminder to all americans that the future is ours to shape if we move forward with confidence and commitment.
it should also serve as a message to the world that the united states of america intends to sustain and strengthen our leadership in this young century.
from this desk, seven and a half years ago, president bush announced the beginning of military operations in iraq.
much has changed since that night.
a war to disarm a state became a fight against an insurgency.
terrorism and sectarian warfare threatened to tear iraq apart.
thousands of americans gave their lives; tens of thousands have been wounded.
our relations abroad were strained.
our unity at home was tested.
these are the rough waters encountered during the course of one of america’s longest wars.
yet there has been one constant amidst these shifting tides.
at every turn, america’s men and women in uniform have served with courage and resolve.
as commander-in-chief, i am incredibly proud of their service.
and like all americans
, i’m awed by their sacrifice, and by the sacrifices of their families.
the americans who have served in iraq completed every mission they were given.
they defeated a regime that had terrorized its people.
together with iraqis and coalition partners who made huge sacrifices of their own, our troops fought block by block to help iraq seize the chance for a better future.
they shifted tactics to protect the iraqi people, trained iraqi security forces, and took out terrorist leaders.
because of our troops and civilians -- and because of the resilience of the iraqi people -- iraq has the opportunity to embrace a new destiny, even though many challenges remain.
so tonight, i am announcing that the american combat mission in iraq has ended.
operation iraqi freedom is over, and the iraqi people now have lead responsibility for the security of their country.
this was my pledge to the american people as a candidate for this office.
last february, i announced a plan that would bring our combat brigades out of iraq, while redoubling our efforts to strengthen iraq’s security forces and support its government and people.
that’s what we’ve done.
we’ve removed nearly 100,000 u.s. troops from iraq.
we’ve closed or transferred to the iraqis hundreds of bases.
and we have moved millions of pieces of equipment out of iraq.
this completes a transition to iraqi responsibility for their own security.
u.s. troops pulled out of iraq
’s cities last summer, and iraqi forces have moved into the lead with considerable skill and commitment to their fellow citizens.
even as iraq continues to suffer terrorist attacks, security incidents have been near the lowest on record since the war began.
and iraqi forces have taken the fight to al qaeda, removing much of its leadership in iraqi-led operations.
this year also saw iraq hold credible elections that drew a strong turnout.
a caretaker administration is in place as iraqis form a government based on the results of that election.
tonight, i encourage iraq’s leaders to move forward with a sense of urgency to form an inclusive government that is just, representative, and accountable to the iraqi people.
and when that government is in place, there should be no doubt:
the iraqi people will have a strong partner in the united states.
our combat mission is ending, but our commitment to iraq’s future is not.
going forward, a transitional force of u.s. troops will remain in iraq with a different mission:  advising and assisting iraq’s security forces, supporting iraqi troops in targeted counterterrorism missions, and protecting our civilians.
consistent with our agreement with the iraqi government, all u.s. troops will leave by the end of next year.
as our military draws down, our dedicated civilians -- diplomats, aid workers, and advisors -- are moving into the lead to support iraq as it strengthens its government, resolves political disputes, resettles those displaced by war, and builds ties with the region and the world.
that’s a message that vice president biden is delivering to the iraqi people through his visit there today.
this new approach reflects our long-term partnership with iraq -- one based upon mutual interest and mutual respect.
of course, violence will not end with our combat mission.
extremists will continue to set off bombs, attack iraqi civilians and try to spark sectarian strife.
but ultimately, these terrorists will fail to achieve their goals.
iraqis are a proud people.
they have rejected sectarian war, and they have no interest in endless destruction.
they understand that, in the end, only iraqis can resolve their differences and police their streets.
only iraqis can build a democracy within their borders.
what america can do, and will do, is provide support for the iraqi people as both a friend and a partner.
ending this war is not only in iraq’s interest --
it’s in our own.
the united states has paid a huge price to put the future of iraq in the hands of its people.
we have sent our young men and women to make enormous sacrifices in iraq, and spent vast resources abroad at a time of tight budgets at home.
we’ve persevered because of a belief we share with the iraqi people -- a belief that out of the ashes of war, a new beginning could be born in this cradle of civilization.
through this remarkable chapter in the history of the united states and iraq, we have met our responsibility.
now, it’s time to turn the page.
as we do, i’m mindful that the iraq war has been a contentious issue at home.
here, too, it’s time to turn the page.
this afternoon, i spoke to former president george w. bush.
it’s well known that he and i disagreed about the war from its outset.
yet no one can doubt president bush’s support for our troops, or his love of country and commitment to our security.
as i’ve said, there were patriots who supported this war, and patriots who opposed it.
and all of us are united in appreciation for our servicemen and women, and our hopes for iraqis’ future.
the greatness of our democracy is grounded in our ability to move beyond our differences, and to learn from our experience as we confront the many challenges ahead.
and no challenge is more essential to our security than our fight against al qaeda.
americans across the political spectrum supported the use of force against those who attacked us on 9/11.
now, as we approach our 10th year of combat in afghanistan, there are those who are understandably asking tough questions about our mission there.
but we must never lose sight of what’s at stake.
as we speak, al qaeda continues to plot against us, and its leadership remains anchored in the border regions of afghanistan and pakistan.
we will disrupt, dismantle and defeat al qaeda, while preventing afghanistan from again serving as a base for terrorists.
and because of our drawdown in iraq, we are now able to apply the resources necessary to go on offense.
in fact, over the last 19 months, nearly a dozen al qaeda leaders -- and hundreds of al qaeda’s extremist allies -- have been killed or captured around the world.
within afghanistan, i’ve ordered the deployment of additional troops who -- under the command of general david petraeus -- are fighting to break the taliban’s momentum.
as with the surge in iraq, these forces will be in place for a limited time to provide space for the afghans to build their capacity and secure their own future.
but, as was the case in iraq, we can’t do for afghans what they must ultimately do for themselves.
that’s why we’re training afghan security forces and supporting a political resolution to afghanistan
’s problems.
and next august, we will begin a transition to afghan responsibility.
the pace of our troop reductions will be determined by conditions on the ground, and our support for afghanistan will endure.
but make no mistake:
this transition will begin -- because open-ended war serves neither our interests nor the afghan people’s.
indeed, one of the lessons of our effort in iraq is that american influence around the world is not a function of military force alone.
we must use all elements of our power -- including our diplomacy, our economic strength, and the power of america’s example -- to secure our interests and stand by our allies.
and we must project a vision of the future that’s
based not just on our fears, but also on our hopes -- a vision that recognizes the real dangers that exist around the world, but also the limitless possibilities of our time.
today, old adversaries are at peace, and emerging democracies are potential partners.
new markets for our goods stretch from asia to the americas.
a new push for peace in the middle east will begin here tomorrow.
billions of young people want to move beyond the shackles of poverty and conflict.
as the leader of the free world, america will do more than just defeat on the battlefield those who offer hatred and destruction -- we will also lead among those who are willing to work together to expand freedom and opportunity for all people.
now, that effort must begin within our own borders.
throughout our history, america has been willing to bear the burden of promoting liberty and human dignity overseas, understanding its links to our own liberty and security.
but we have also understood that our nation’s strength and influence abroad must be firmly anchored in our prosperity at home.
and the bedrock of that prosperity must be a growing middle class.
unfortunately, over the last decade, we’ve not done what’s necessary to shore up the foundations of our own prosperity.
we spent a trillion dollars at war, often financed by borrowing from overseas.
this, in turn, has short-changed investments in our own people, and contributed to record deficits.
for too long, we have put off tough decisions on everything from our manufacturing base to our energy policy to education reform.
as a result, too many middle-class families find themselves working harder for less, while our nation’s long-term competitiveness is put at risk.
and so at this moment, as we wind down the war in iraq, we must tackle those challenges at home with as much energy, and grit, and sense of common purpose as our men and women in uniform who have served abroad.
they have met every test that they faced.
now, it’s
our turn.
now, it’s our responsibility to honor them by coming together, all of us, and working to secure the dream that so many generations have fought for -- the dream that a better life awaits anyone who is willing to work for it and reach for it.
our most urgent task is to restore our economy, and put the millions of americans who have lost their jobs back to work.
to strengthen our middle class, we must give all our children the education they deserve, and all our workers the skills that they need to compete in a global economy.
we must jumpstart industries that create jobs, and end our dependence on foreign oil.
we must unleash the innovation that allows new products to roll off our assembly lines, and nurture the ideas that spring from our entrepreneurs.
this will be difficult.
but in the days to come, it must be our central mission as a people, and my central responsibility as president.
part of that responsibility is making sure that we honor our commitments to those who have served our country with such valor.
as long as i am president, we will maintain the finest fighting force that the world has ever known, and we will do whatever it takes to serve our veterans as well as they have served us.
this is a sacred trust.
that’s why we’ve already made one of the largest increases in funding for veterans in decades.
we’re treating the signature wounds of today’s wars -- post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury -- while providing the health care and benefits that all of our veterans have earned.
and we’re funding a post-9/11 gi bill that helps our veterans and their families
pursue the dream of a college education.
just as the gi bill helped those who fought world war ii -- including my grandfather -- become the backbone of our middle class, so today’s servicemen and women must have the chance to apply their gifts to expand the american economy.
because part of ending a war responsibly is standing by those who have fought it.
two weeks ago, america’s final combat brigade in iraq -- the army’s fourth stryker brigade -- journeyed home in the pre-dawn darkness.
thousands of soldiers and hundreds of vehicles made the trip from baghdad, the last of them passing into kuwait in the early morning hours.
over seven years before, american troops and coalition partners had fought their way across similar highways, but this time no shots were fired.
it was just a convoy of brave americans, making their way home.
of course, the soldiers left much behind.
some were teenagers when the war began.
many have served multiple tours of duty, far from families who bore a heroic burden of their own, enduring the absence of a husband’s embrace or a mother’s kiss.
most painfully, since the war began, 55 members of the fourth stryker brigade made the ultimate sacrifice -- part of over 4,400 americans who have given their lives in iraq.
as one staff sergeant said, “i know that to my brothers in arms who fought and died, this day would probably mean a lot.”
those americans gave their lives for the values that have lived in the hearts of our people for over two centuries.
along with nearly 1.5 million americans who have served in iraq, they fought in a faraway place for people they never knew.
they stared into the darkest of human creations -- war -- and helped the iraqi people seek the light of peace.
in an age without surrender ceremonies, we must earn victory through the success of our partners and the strength of our own nation.
every american who serves joins an unbroken line of heroes that stretches from lexington to gettysburg; from iwo jima to inchon; from khe sanh to kandahar -- americans who have fought to see that the lives of our children are better than our own.
our troops are the steel in our ship of state.
and though our nation may be travelling through rough waters, they give us confidence that our course is true, and that beyond the pre-dawn darkness, better days lie ahead.
thank you.
may god bless you.
and may god bless the united states of america, and all who serve her.
well, welcome to the white house.
to you, to muslim americans across our country, and to more than one billion muslims around the world, i extend my best wishes on this holy month.
ramadan kareem.
i want to welcome members of the diplomatic corps; members of my administration; and members of congress, including rush holt, john conyers, and andre carson, who is one of two muslim american members of congress, along with keith ellison.
so welcome, all of you.
here at the white house, we have a tradition of hosting iftars that goes back several years, just as we host christmas parties and seders and diwali celebrations.
and these events celebrate the role of faith in the lives of the american people.
they remind us of the basic truth that we are all children of god, and we all draw strength and a sense of purpose from our beliefs.
these events are also an affirmation of who we are as americans.
our founders understood that the best way to honor the place of faith in the lives of our people was to protect their freedom to practice religion.
in the virginia act of establishing religion freedom, thomas jefferson wrote that “all men shall be free to profess, and by argument to maintain, their opinions in matters of religion.”
the first amendment of our constitution established the freedom of religion as the law of the land.
and that right has been upheld ever since.
indeed, over the course of our history, religion has flourished within our borders precisely because americans have had the right to worship as they choose -- including the right to believe in no religion at all.
and it is a testament to the wisdom of our founders that america remains deeply religious -- a nation where the ability of peoples of different faiths to coexist peacefully and with mutual respect for one another stands in stark contrast to the religious conflict that persists elsewhere around the globe.
now, that's not to say that religion is without controversy.
recently, attention has been focused on the construction of mosques in certain communities -- particularly new york.
now, we must all recognize and respect the sensitivities surrounding the development of lower manhattan.
the 9/11 attacks were a deeply traumatic event for our country.
and the pain and the experience of suffering by those who lost loved ones is just unimaginable.
so i understand the emotions that this issue engenders.
and ground zero is, indeed, hallowed ground.
but let me be clear.
as a citizen, and as president, i believe that muslims have the same right to practice their religion as everyone else in this country.
and that includes the right to build a place of worship and a community center on private property in lower manhattan, in accordance with local laws and ordinances.
this is america.
and our commitment to religious freedom must be unshakeable.
the principle that people of all faiths are welcome in this country and that they will not be treated differently by their government is essential to who we are.
the writ of the founders must endure.
we must never forget those who we lost so tragically on 9/11, and we must always honor those who led the response to that attack -- from the firefighters who charged up smoke-filled staircases, to our troops who are serving in afghanistan today.
and let us also remember who we’re fighting against, and what we’re fighting for.
our enemies respect no religious freedom.
al qaeda
’s
cause is not islam -- it’s a gross distortion of islam.
these are not religious leaders -- they’re terrorists who murder innocent men and women and children.
in fact, al qaeda has killed more muslims than people of any other religion -- and that list of victims includes innocent muslims who were killed on 9/11.
so that's who we’re fighting against.
and the reason that we will win this fight is not simply the strength of our arms -- it is the strength of our values.
the democracy that we uphold.
the freedoms that we cherish.
the laws that we apply without regard to race, or religion, or wealth, or status.
our capacity to show not merely tolerance, but respect towards those who are different from us -- and that way of life, that quintessentially american creed, stands in stark contrast to the nihilism of those who attacked us on that september morning, and who continue to plot against us today.
in my inaugural address
i said that our patchwork heritage is a strength, not a weakness.
we are a nation of christians and muslims, jews and hindus -- and non-believers.
we are shaped by every language and every culture, drawn from every end of this earth.
and that diversity can bring difficult debates.
this is not unique to our time.
past eras have seen controversies about the construction of synagogues or catholic churches.
but time and again, the american people have demonstrated that we can work through these issues, and stay true to our core values, and emerge stronger for it.
so it must be -- and will be -- today.
and tonight, we are reminded that ramadan is a celebration of a faith known for great diversity.
and ramadan is a reminder that islam has always been a part of america.
the first muslim ambassador to the united states, from tunisia, was hosted by president jefferson, who arranged a sunset dinner for his guest because it was ramadan -- making it the first known iftar at the white house, more than 200 years ago.
like so many other immigrants, generations of muslims came to forge their future here.
they became farmers and merchants, worked in mills and factories.
they helped lay the railroads.
they helped to build america.
they founded the first islamic center in new york city in the 1890s.
they built america’s first mosque on the prairie of north dakota.
and perhaps the oldest surviving mosque in america -- still in use today -- is in cedar rapids, iowa.
today, our nation is strengthened by millions of muslim americans.
they excel in every walk of life.
muslim american communities -- including mosques in all 50 states -- also serve their neighbors.
muslim americans protect our communities as police officers and firefighters and first responders.
muslim american clerics have spoken out against terror and extremism, reaffirming that islam teaches that one must save human life, not take it.
and muslim americans serve with honor in our military.
at next week’s iftar at the pentagon, tribute will be paid to three soldiers who gave their lives in iraq and now rest among the heroes of arlington national cemetery.
these muslim americans died for the security that we depend on, and the freedoms that we cherish.
they are part of an unbroken line of americans that stretches back to our founding; americans of all faiths who have served and sacrificed to extend the promise of america to new generations, and to ensure that what is exceptional about america is protected -- our commitment to stay true to our core values, and our ability slowly but surely to perfect our union.
for in the end, we remain “one nation, under god, indivisible.”
and we can only achieve “liberty and justice for all” if we live by that one rule at the heart of every great religion, including islam -- that we do unto others as we would have them do unto us.
so thank you all for being here.
i wish you a blessed ramadan.
and with that, let us eat.
it is -- thank you.
it is a great honor and -- it is true, i will be 49 this week.
i have a lot more gray hair than i did last year.
it is an extraordinary honor to be here.
thank you, commander barrera, for your kind introduction and for your lifetime of service, in the marines in vietnam -- but also as a tireless advocate for your fellow disabled veterans.
we are grateful to you.
thank you for everything that you've done.
i want to thank your great leadership team for welcoming me today: chairman ray dempsey -- absolutely -- incoming commander wally tyson.
national adjutant art wilson.
judy hezlep of the dav auxiliary.
and your outstanding executive director in washington, dave gorman.
and i am pleased to be joined by a decorated vietnam veteran, wounded warrior, and a lifetime member of the dav -- my outstanding secretary of veterans affairs, ric shinseki.
disabled american veterans, i valued your advice and counsel when i was a senator, when i co-sponsored the post-9/11 gi bill.
you were one of the first veterans organizations that i called upon when i began my presidential campaign.
and as president, it's been my pleasure to welcome you to the white house -- to make sure america is serving our veterans as well as you've served us.
and, most recently, to sign advanced appropriations into law so that veterans health care will never again be held hostage to the budget battles and the political games in washington.
now, there's another visit i won't forget.
i was in the oval office expecting a visit from the dav.
and in comes bobby carrying a baseball bat.
now, it's not every day that somebody gets past the secret service carrying a baseball bat.
you may have heard about this.
it turns out it was a genuine louisville slugger --
a thank you for going to bat for our veterans on advanced appropriations.
so i'm grateful for that symbol of our partnership, and i'm proud of the progress we've achieved together.
but as one of your outstanding dav members from illinois just reminded me, this is a promise i made during the campaign -- it was a promise made and it was a promise kept.
and i intend to keep on keeping my promises to the veterans of america.
in the life of our nation, not every generation has been summoned to defend our country in its hour of need.
but every generation to answer that call has done so with honor and with courage.
among you are members of that generation that saved the world from fascism.
i was honored to stand with our world war ii vets at normandy last year for the anniversary of d-day.
and this year, as we mark -- this year, as we mark the 65th anniversary of our victory in that war, we once again salute our veterans of the second world war.
others among you faced a brutal foe on a cold korean peninsula.
this year, as we mark the 60th anniversary of that conflict, i will be proud to travel to the republic of korea in november to pay tribute to our veterans of the korean war.
many of you served in the jungles of vietnam.
you also served with honor, exemplary dedication and courage, but were often shunned when you came home.
that was a national disgrace and it must never happen again.
and that's why we're making sure our veterans from today's wars are shown the respect and the dignity they deserve.
and whether you served in the gulf to free a captive kuwait or fought in the streets of mogadishu or stopped an ethnic slaughter in the balkans, you too are part of an unbroken line of service stretching across two centuries.
for you, coming home was the beginning of another battle -- the battle to recover.
you fought to stand again and to walk again and to work again.
you fought for each other and for the benefits and treatment you had earned.
you became leaders in our communities, in our companies, and our country -- including a former vietnam vet and senator, max cleland, who reminded us that america's disabled veterans are "strong at the broken places."
today, your legacy of service is carried on by a new generation of americans.
some stepped forward in a time of peace, not foreseeing years of combat.
others stepped forward in this time of war, knowing they could be sent into harm's way.
for the past nine years, in afghanistan and iraq, they have borne the burdens of war.
they, and their families, have faced the greatest test in the history of our all-volunteer force, serving tour after tour, year after year.
through their extraordinary service, they have written their own chapter in the american story.
and by any measure, they have earned their place among the greatest of generations.
now, one of those chapters is nearing an end.
as a candidate for president, i pledged to bring the war in iraq to a responsible end.
shortly after taking office, i announced our new strategy for iraq and for a transition to full iraqi responsibility.
and i made it clear that by august 31st, 2010, america's combat mission in iraq would end.
and that is exactly what we are doing -- as promised and on schedule.
already, we have closed or turned over to iraq hundreds of bases.
we're moving out millions of pieces of equipment in one of the largest logistics operations that we've seen in decades.
by the end of this month, we'll have brought more than 90,000 of our troops home from iraq since i took office -- more than 90,000 have come home.
today -- even as terrorists try to derail iraq's progress -- because of the sacrifices of our troops and their iraqi partners, violence in iraq continues to be near the lowest it's been in years.
and next month, we will change our military mission from combat to supporting and training iraqi security forces.
in fact, in many parts of the country, iraqis have already taken the lead for security.
as agreed to with the iraqi government, we will maintain a transitional force until we remove all our troops from iraq by the end of next year.
and during this period, our forces will have a focused mission -- supporting and training iraqi forces, partnering with iraqis in counterterrorism missions, and protecting our civilian and military efforts.
these are dangerous tasks.
there are still those with bombs and bullets who will try to stop iraq's progress.
and the hard truth is we have not seen the end of american sacrifice in iraq.
but make no mistake: our commitment in iraq is changing -- from a military effort led by our troops to a civilian effort led by our diplomats.
and as we mark the end of america's combat mission in iraq, a grateful america must pay tribute to all who served there.
remember, our nation has had vigorous debates about the iraq war.
there are patriots who supported going to war, and patriots who opposed it.
but there has never been any daylight between us when it comes to supporting the more than one million americans in uniform who have served in iraq -- far more than any conflict since vietnam.
these men and women from across our country have done more than meet the challenges of this young century.
through their extraordinary courage and confidence and commitment, these troops and veterans have proven themselves as a new generation of american leaders.
and while our country has sometimes been divided, they have fought together as one.
while other individuals and institutions have shirked responsibility, they have welcomed responsibility.
while it was easy to be daunted by overwhelming challenges, the generation that has served in iraq has overcome every test before them.
they took to the skies and sped across deserts in the initial charge into baghdad.
and today we're joined by an infantryman who was there as part of the 101st airborne division -- sergeant nicholas bernardi is here.
when invasion gave way to insurgency, our troops persevered, block by block, city by city, from baghdad to fallujah.
as a driver in a transportation company, this soldier endured constant attacks but never waivered in his mission -- and we thank sergeant dan knabe.
thank you, dan.
when terrorists and militias plunged iraq into sectarian war, our troops adapted and adjusted -- restoring order and effectively defeating al qaeda in iraq on the battlefield.
and among those who served in those pivotal days was a scout with the 1st cavalry division -- specialist matt seidl.
matt.
for each of these men and women there are countless others.
and we honor them all: our young enlisted troops and noncommissioned officers who are the backbone of our military; the national guardsmen and reservists who served in unprecedented deployments; more women tested by combat than in any war in american history.
including a marine here today -- sergeant patricia ruiz.
patricia.
i teased patricia.
i said she looks like she's still in high school.
but she's a marine.
and we salute the families back home.
they too have sacrificed in this war.
that's why my wife, michelle, and the vice president's wife, dr. jill biden, have made it their mission to make sure america takes care of our remarkable military families, including our veterans.
now, this summer, tens of thousands of our troops in iraq are coming home.
last week, vice president biden was at fort drum to help welcome back members of the legendary 10th mountain division.
families are being reunited at bases across the country, from fort bragg in north carolina to fort riley in kansas to fort lewis in washington.
and in this season of homecomings, every american can show their gratitude to our patriots who served in iraq.
as we do, we are humbled by the profound sacrifice that has been rendered.
each of the veterans i have mentioned carried with them the wounds of this war.
and as a nation, we will honor forever all who gave their lives -- that last true measure of devotion -- in service in iraq -- soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, coast guardsmen -- active, guard, reserve.
even as we end the war in iraq, even as we welcome home
so many of our troops, others are still deployed in afghanistan.
so i want to remind everyone, it was afghanistan where al qaeda plotted and trained to murder 3,000 innocent people on 9/11.
it is afghanistan and the tribal regions of pakistan where terrorists have launched other attacks against us and our allies.
and if afghanistan were to be engulfed by an even wider insurgency, al qaeda and its terrorist affiliates would have even more space to plan their next attack.
and as president of the united states, i refuse to let that happen.
the effort in afghanistan has been long and been difficult.
and that's why after years in which the situation had deteriorated, i announced a new strategy last december -- a military effort to break the taliban's momentum and train afghan forces so that they can take the lead for their security; and a civilian effort to promote good governance and development that improves the lives of the afghan people; and deeper cooperation with pakistan to root out terrorists on both sides of the border.
we will continue to face huge challenges in afghanistan.
but it's important that the american people know that we are making progress
and we are focused on goals that are clear and achievable.
on the military front, nearly all the additional forces that i ordered to afghanistan are now in place.
along with our afghan and international partners, we are going on the offensive against the taliban -- targeting their leaders, challenging them in regions where they had free reign, and training afghan national security forces.
our thoughts and prayers are with all our troops risking their lives for our safety in afghanistan.
and on the civilian front, we're insisting on greater accountability.
and the afghan government has taken concrete steps to foster development and combat corruption, and to put forward a reintegration plan that allows afghans to lay down their arms.
in pakistan, we've seen the government begin to take the fight to violent extremists within its borders, and major blows have been struck against al qaeda and its leadership -- because in this region and beyond, we will tolerate no safe haven for al qaeda and their extremist allies.
we will disrupt, we will dismantle, and we will ultimately defeat al qaeda.
and we will give our troops the resources and the equipment to get the job done and keep our country safe.
at the same time, every american who has ever worn the uniform must also know this: your country is going to take care of you when you come home.
our nation's commitment to our veterans, to you and your families, is a sacred trust.
and to me and my administration, upholding that trust is a moral obligation.
it's not just politics.
that's why i've charged secretary shinseki with building a 21st century va.
and that includes one of the largest percentage increases to the va budget in the past 30 years.
we are going to cut this deficit that we've got, and i've proposed a freeze on discretionary domestic spending.
but what i have not frozen is the spending we need to keep our military strong, our country safe and our veterans secure.
so we're going to keep on making historic commitments to our veterans.
for about 200,000 vietnam vets who may have been exposed to agent orange and who now suffer from three chronic diseases, we're making it easier for you to get the health care and benefits you need.
for our gulf war veterans, we've declared that nine infectious diseases are now presumed to be related to your service in desert storm.
for our disabled veterans, we've eliminated co-pays for those of you who are catastrophically disabled.
we've kept our promise on concurrent receipt by proposing legislation that would allow severely disabled retirees to receive your military retired pay and your va disability benefits.
it's the right thing to do.
we've dramatically increased funding for veterans health care across the board, and that includes improving care for rural veterans and women veterans.
for those half-million vets who had lost their eligibility -- our priority 8 veterans -- we're restoring your access to va health care.
and since the rumors continue to fly, even though they are wrong, let me say it as clearly as i can: the historic health care reform legislation that i signed into law does not -- i repeat, does not -- change your veterans benefits.
the va health care benefits that you know and trust are safe, and that includes prosthetics for our disabled veterans.
thanks to advanced appropriations, the delays for funding for veterans medical care are over.
and just as those delays were unacceptable, so too are long delays in the claims process.
so secretary shinseki is working overtime to create a single lifetime electronic record that our troops and veterans can keep for life.
and today -- today i can announce that for the first time ever, veterans will be able to go to the va website, click a simple "blue button," and download or print your personal health records
so you have them when you need them and can share them with your doctors outside of the va.
that's happening this fall.
we're hiring thousands of new claims processors to break the backlog once and for all.
and to make sure the backlog doesn't come back, we're reforming the claims process itself with new information technologies and a paperless system.
we got an amen over here.
as a result of the innovation competition that i announced last summer, our dedicated va employees suggested more than 10,000 new ways to cut through the red tape and the bureaucracy.
and we're already putting dozens of these innovative ideas into action.
additionally, we're enabling more veterans to check the status of their claims online and from their cell phone.
as a next step, we're opening this competition to entrepreneurs and academics
so the best minds in america can help us develop the technologies to serve our vets, including those of you with multiple traumatic injuries.
and we're going to keep at this until we meet our commitment to cut those backlogs, slash those wait times, and deliver your benefits sooner.
this is a priority and we are going to get it done.
we're making progress in ending homelessness among our veterans.
today, on any given night, there are about 20,000 fewer veterans on the streets than there were when we took office.
but we're not going to be satisfied until every veteran who has fought for america has a home in america.
we will not stop.
finally, we're keeping faith with our newest veterans returning from afghanistan and iraq.
we're offering more of the support and counseling
they need to transition back to civilian life.
that includes funding the post-9/11 gi bill, which is already helping more than 300,000 veterans and family members pursue their dream of a college education.
and for veterans trying to find work in a very tough economy, we're helping with job training and placement.
and i've directed the federal government to make it a priority to hire more veterans, including disabled veterans.
and every business in america needs to know our vets have the training, they've got the skills
, they have the dedication -- they are ready to work.
and our country is stronger when we tap the incredible talents of our veterans.
for those coming home injured, we're continuing to direct unprecedented support to our wounded warriors in uniform -- more treatment centers, more case managers -- delivering the absolute best care available.
for those who can, we want to help them get back to where they want to be -- with their units.
and that includes service members with a disability, who still have so much to offer our military.
we're directing unprecedented resources to treating the signature wounds of today's wars -- traumatic brain injury and post traumatic stress disorder.
and i recently signed into law the caregivers and veterans omnibus health services act.
that's a long name, but let me tell you what it does.
it not only improves treatment for traumatic brain injury and ptsd, it gives new support to many of the caregivers who put their own lives on hold to care for their loved one.
and as so many of you know, ptsd is a pain like no other -- the nightmares that keep coming back, the rage that strikes suddenly, the hopelessness that's led too many of our troops and veterans to take their own lives.
so today, i want to say in very personal terms to anyone who is struggling -- don't suffer in silence.
it's not a sign of weakness to reach out for support -- it's a sign of strength.
your country needs you.
we are here for you.
we are here to help you stand tall.
don't give up.
reach out.
we're making major investments in awareness, outreach, and suicide prevention -- hiring more mental health professionals, improving care and treatment.
for those of you suffering from ptsd, we're making it a whole lot easier to qualify for va benefits.
from now on, if a va doctor confirms a diagnosis of post traumatic stress disorder, that is enough -- no matter what war you served in.
these are the commitments my administration has made.
these are the promises we've worked to keep.
this is the sacred trust we have pledged to uphold -- to you and all who serve.
i want to make special mention of a truly inspiring american, staff sergeant cory remsburg.
he was at bethesda during one of my periodic visits to see our wounded warriors.
and as i walked into his room, i saw a picture on the wall -- and it was a picture of the two of us together.
see, i had met cory before, back at the d-day anniversary in normandy.
a good looking young man, a proud army ranger
, he had joined in a reenactment of that historic paratroop jump.
then soon after, cory served on his 10th deployment since 9/11 --
that's right, his 10th deployment.
and that's when an ied nearly took his life.
the traumatic brain injury was severe.
cory was in a coma for months.
it seemed possible that he would never wake up.
but then something happened.
his doctors still can't explain it.
his parents called it a miracle.
cory opened one of his eyes.
then a few weeks later, he moved a leg.
then he moved an arm.
and there at bethesda, we were meeting again.
and cory still couldn't speak.
but he looked me in the eye.
he lifted his arm and he shook my hand firmly.
and when i asked how he was feeling, he held up his hand, pulled his fingers together and gave a thumbs up.
today, cory is at a va hospital in florida.
and with the support of his family and va staff, he's working hard every day to regain his strength.
he's got to learn to speak all over again.
he's grateful for the visits he's received from friends and supporters -- including the disabled american veterans.
and cory is only 27 years old.
he knows he's got a long and very hard road ahead.
but he pushes on, and he's determined to get back to his fellow rangers.
and when someone at the hospital said, "cory, you're going to walk out of here someday," he said "no, i'm going to run out of here."
so to staff sergeant cory remsburg, to the disabled american veterans -- i want to say to all of you, you are the very essence of america, the values that sustain us as a people, and the virtues our nation needs most right now.
and the resilience that, in the face of great loss, so many of you experienced, i know you, like cory, know what it means to pick yourselves up and keep pushing on.
and that sense of purpose that tells us to carry on, not just when it's easy, but when it's hard, even when the odds seem overwhelming -- that's what we're about.
the confidence that our destiny is never written for us, it's written by us.
the faith, that fundamental american faith, that there are always brighter days ahead; and that we not will not simply endure, but we will emerge from our tests and trials and tribulations stronger than before -- that is your story.
that is america's story.
and i'm proud to stand with you as we write the next proud chapter in the life of the country we love.
god bless you, and god bless the united states of america.
thank you.
everybody, please have a seat, have a seat.
well, good morning, everyone.
we are gathered in the heart of our nation’s capital, surrounded by memorials to leaders and citizens who served our nation in its earliest days and in its days of greatest trial.
today is such a time for america.
over the past two years, we have faced the worst recession since the great depression.
eight million people lost their jobs.
tens of millions saw the value of their homes and retirement savings plummet.
countless businesses have been unable to get the loans they need and many have been forced to shut their doors.
and although the economy is growing again, too many people are still feeling the pain of the downturn.
now, while a number of factors led to such a severe recession, the primary cause was a breakdown in our financial system.
it was a crisis born of a failure of responsibility from certain corners of wall street to the halls of power in washington.
for years, our financial sector was governed by antiquated and poorly enforced rules that allowed some to game the system and take risks that endangered the entire economy.
unscrupulous lenders locked consumers into complex loans with hidden costs.
firms like aig placed massive, risky bets with borrowed money.
and while the rules left abuse and excess unchecked, they also left taxpayers on the hook if a big bank or financial institution ever failed.
now, even before the crisis hit, i went to wall street
and i called for common-sense reforms to protect consumers and our economy as a whole.
and soon after taking office, i proposed a set of reforms to empower consumers and investors, to bring the shadowy deals that caused this crisis into the light of day, and to put a stop to taxpayer bailouts once and for all.
today, thanks to a lot of people in this room, those reforms will become the law of the land.
for the last year, chairmen barney frank and chris dodd have worked day and night.
barney and chris have worked day and night to bring about this reform.
and i am profoundly grateful to them.
i would be remiss if i didn't also express my appreciation to senator harry reid and speaker nancy pelosi for their leadership.
it wouldn’t have happened without them.
passing this bill was no easy task.
to get there, we had to overcome the furious lobbying of an array of powerful interest groups and a partisan minority determined to block change.
so the members who are here today, both on the stage and in the audience, they have done a great service in devoting so much time and expertise to this effort, to looking out for the public interests and not the special interests.
and i also want to thank the three republican senators who put partisanship aside, judged this bill on the merits, and voted for reform.
we’re grateful to them.
and the republican house members.
good to see you, joe.
now, let’s put this in perspective.
the fact is, the financial industry is central to our nation’s ability to grow, to prosper, to compete and to innovate.
there are a lot of banks that understand and fulfill this vital role, and there are a whole lot of bankers who want to do right -- and do right -- by their customers.
this reform will help foster innovation, not hamper it.
it is designed to make sure that everybody follows the same set of rules, so that firms compete on price and quality, not on tricks and not on traps.
it demands accountability and responsibility from everyone.
it provides certainty to everybody, from bankers to farmers to business owners to consumers.
and unless your business model depends on cutting corners or bilking your customers, you’ve got nothing to fear from reform.
now, for all those americans who are wondering what wall street reform means for you, here’s what you can expect.
if you’ve ever applied for a credit card, a student loan, or a mortgage, you know the feeling of signing your name to pages of barely understandable fine print.
what often happens as a result is that many americans are caught by hidden fees and penalties, or saddled with loans they can’t afford.
that’s what happened to robin fox, hit with a massive rate increase on her credit card balance even though she paid her bills on time.
that’s what happened to andrew giordano, who discovered hundreds of dollars in overdraft fees on his bank statement –- fees
he had no idea he might face.
both are here today.
well, with this law, unfair rate hikes, like the one that hit robin, will end for good.
and we’ll ensure that people like andrew aren’t unwittingly caught by overdraft fees when they sign up for a checking account.
with this law, we’ll crack down on abusive practices in the mortgage industry.
we’ll make sure that contracts are simpler -– putting an end to many hidden penalties and fees in complex mortgages -–
so folks know what they’re signing.
with this law, students who take out college loans will be provided clear and concise information about their obligations.
and with this law, ordinary investors -– like seniors and folks saving for retirement –- will be able to receive more information about the costs and risks of mutual funds and other investment products, so that they can make better financial decisions as to what will work for them.
so, all told, these reforms represent the strongest consumer financial protections in history.
in history.
and these protections will be enforced by a new consumer watchdog with just one job:
looking out for people -–
not big banks, not lenders, not investment houses -– looking out for people as they interact with the financial system.
and that’s not just good for consumers;
that’s good for the economy.
because reform will put a stop to a lot of the bad loans that fueled a debt-based bubble.
and it will mean all companies will have to seek customers by offering better products, instead of more deceptive ones.
now, beyond the consumer protections i’ve outlined, reform will also rein in the abuse and excess that nearly brought down our financial system.
it will finally bring transparency to the kinds of complex and risky transactions that helped trigger the financial crisis.
shareholders will also have a greater say on the pay of ceos and other executives, so they can reward success instead of failure.
and finally, because of this law, the american people will never again be asked to foot the bill for wall street’s mistakes.
there will be no more tax-funded bailouts -- period.
if a large financial institution should ever fail, this reform gives us the ability to wind it down without endangering the broader economy.
and there will be new rules to make clear that no firm is somehow protected because it is “too big to fail,”
so we don’t have another aig.
that's what this reform will mean.
now, it doesn’t mean our work is over.
for these new rules to be effective, regulators will have to be vigilant.
we may need to make adjustments along the way as our financial system adapts to these new changes and changes around the globe.
no law can force anybody to be responsible; it’s still incumbent on those on wall street to heed the lessons of this crisis in terms of how they conduct their businesses.
the fact is every american -– from main street to wall street –- has a stake in our financial system.
wall street banks and firms invest the capital that makes it possible for start-ups to sell new products.
they provide loans to businesses to expand and to hire.
they back mortgages for families purchasing a new home.
that’s why we
’ll all stand to gain from these reforms.
we all win when investors around the world have confidence in our markets.
we all win when shareholders have more power and more information.
we all win when consumers are protected against abuse.
and we all win when folks are rewarded based on how well they perform, not how well they evade accountability.
in the end, our financial system only works –- our market is only free –- when there are clear rules and basic safeguards that prevent abuse, that check excess, that ensure that it is more profitable to play by the rules than to game the system.
and that’s what these reforms are designed to achieve -- no more, no less.
because that’s how we will ensure that our economy works for consumers, that it works for investors, that it works for financial institutions -
– that it works for all of us.
this is the central lesson not only of this crisis but of our history.
ultimately, there’s no dividing line between main street and wall street.
we rise or fall together as one nation.
so these reforms will help lift our economy and lead all of us to a stronger, more prosperous future.
and that’s why i’m so honored to sign these reforms into law, and
i’m so grateful to everybody who worked so hard to make this day possible.
thank you very much, everybody.
to mona and marjorie, and to senator byrd’s entire family, including those adorable great granddaughters that i had a chance to meet -- michelle
and i offer you our deepest sympathies.
to senator byrd’s friends, including the speaker of the house, the majority leader, the republican leader, president clinton, vice president biden, vicki kennedy, nick rahall and all the previous speakers; senator rockefeller for the outstanding work that you’ve done for the state of west virginia; to his larger family -- the people of west virginia -- i want you all to know that all america shares your loss.
may we all find comfort in a verse of scripture that reminds me of our dear friend:  “the time of my departure has come.
i have fought the good fight
, i have finished the race, i have kept the faith.”
it’s interesting that you’ve heard that passage from several speakers now, because it embodies somebody who knew how to run a good and long race, and somebody who knew how to keep the faith -- with his state, with his family, with his country and his constitution.
years from now, when i think of the man we memorialize today, i’ll remember him as he was when i came to know him, his white hair full like a mane, his gait steadied with a cane.
determined to make the most of every last breath, the distinguished gentleman from west virginia could be found at his desk until the very end, doing the people’s business, delivering soul-stirring speeches, a hint of the appalachians in his voice, stabbing the air with his finger, fiery as ever, years into his 10th decade.
he was a senate icon.
he was a party leader.
he was an elder statesman.
and he was my friend.
that’s
how i’ll remember him.
today we remember the path he climbed to such extraordinary peaks.
born cornelius calvin sale, jr. -- corny
, he joked, for short -- his mother lost her life in the great influenza pandemic of 1918.
from the aunt and uncle who raised him, amid west virginia’s coal camps, he gained not only his byrd name but a reverence for god almighty, a love of learning that was nurtured at mark twain school.
and there he met erma, his sweetheart for over 70 years, by whose side he will now rest for eternity.
unable to afford college, he did what he could to get by, finding work as a gas station attendant, a produce salesman, a meat-cutter, and a welder in the shipyards of baltimore and tampa during world war ii.
returning home to west virginia after the war, he ran for the state house of delegates, using his fiddle case as a briefcase, the better to stand out on the stump.
before long, he ran for congress, serving in the house before jumping over to the senate, where he was elected nine times, held almost every leadership role imaginable, and proved as capable of swaying others as standing alone, marking a row of milestones along the way.
longest-serving member of congress.
nearly 19,000 votes cast.
not a single loss at the polls -- a record that speaks to the bond that he had with you, the people of his state.
transplanted to washington, his heart remained here, in west virginia, in the place that shaped him, with the people he loved.
his heart belonged to you.
making life better here was his only agenda.
giving you hope, he said, was his greatest achievement.
hope in the form of new jobs and industries.
hope in the form of black lung benefits and union protections.
hope through roads and research centers, schools and scholarships, health clinics and industrial parks that bear his name.
his early rival and late friend, ted kennedy, used to joke about campaigning in west virginia.
when his bus broke down, ted got hold of the highway patrol, who asked where he was.
and he said, “i’m on robert byrd highway.”
and the dispatcher said, “
which one?”
it’s a life that immeasurably improved the lives of west virginians.
of course, robert byrd was a deeply religious man, a christian.
and so he understood that our lives are marked by sins as well as virtues, failures as well as success, weakness as well as strength.
we know there are things he said -- and things he did -- that he came to regret.
i remember talking about that the first time i visited with him.
he said, “there are things i regretted in my youth.
you may know that.”
and i said, “none of us are absent some regrets, senator.
that’s why we enjoy and seek the grace of god.”
and as i reflect on the full sweep of his 92 years, it seems to me that his life bent towards justice.
like the constitution he tucked in his pocket, like our nation itself, robert byrd possessed that quintessential american quality, and that is a capacity to change, a capacity to learn, a capacity to listen, a capacity to be made more perfect.
over his nearly six decades in our capitol, he came to be seen as the very embodiment of the senate, chronicling its history in four volumes that he gave to me just as he gave to president clinton.
i, too, read it.
i was scared he was going to quiz me.
but as i soon discovered, his passion for the senate’s past, his mastery of even its most arcane procedures, it wasn’t an obsession with the trivial or the obscure.
it reflected a profoundly noble impulse, a recognition of a basic truth about this country that we are not a nation of men, we are a nation of laws.
our way of life rests on our democratic institutions.
precisely because we are fallible, it falls to each of us to safeguard these institutions, even when it’s inconvenient, and pass on our republic more perfect than before.
considering the vast learning of this self-taught senator -- his speeches sprinkled with the likes of cicero and shakespeare and jefferson
-- it seems fitting to close with one of his favorite passages in literature, a passage from moby dick:
“and there is a catskill eagle in some souls that can alike dive down into the blackest gorges, and soar out of them again and become invisible in the sunny spaces.
and even if he forever flies within the gorge, that gorge is in the mountains; so that even in his lowest swoop the mountain eagle is still higher than any other bird upon the plain, even though they soar.”
robert byrd was a mountain eagle, and his lowest swoop was still higher than the other birds upon the plain.
may god bless robert c. byrd.
may he be welcomed kindly by the righteous judge.
and may his spirit soar forever like a catskill eagle, high above the heavens.
thank you very much.
thank you.
everyone please have a seat.
thank you very much.
let -- let me thank pastor hybels from near my hometown in chicago, who took time off his vacation to be here today.
we are blessed to have him.
i want to thank president neil kerwin and our hosts here at american university; acknowledge my outstanding secretary of labor, hilda solis, and members of my administration; all the members of congress -- hilda deserves applause.
to all the members of congress, the elected officials, faith and law enforcement, labor, business leaders and immigration advocates who are here today -- thank you for your presence.
i want to thank american university for welcoming me to the campus once again.
some may recall that the last time i was here i was joined by a dear friend, and a giant of american politics, senator edward kennedy.
teddy
’s not here right now, but his legacy of civil rights and health care and worker protections is still with us.
i was a candidate for president that day, and some may recall
i argued that our country had reached a tipping point; that after years in which we had deferred our most pressing problems, and too often yielded to the politics of the moment, we now faced a choice:
we could squarely confront our challenges with honesty and determination, or we could consign ourselves and our children to a future less prosperous and less secure.
i believed that then and i believe it now.
and that’s why, even as we’ve tackled the most severe economic crisis since the great depression, even as we’ve wound down the war in iraq and refocused our efforts in afghanistan, my administration has refused to ignore some of the fundamental challenges facing this generation.
we launched the most aggressive education reforms in decades, so that our children can gain the knowledge and skills they need to compete in a 21st century global economy.
we have finally delivered on the promise of health reform -- reform that will bring greater security to every american, and that will rein in the skyrocketing costs that threaten families, businesses and the prosperity of our nation.
we’re on the verge of reforming an outdated and ineffective set of rules governing wall street -- to give greater power to consumers and prevent the reckless financial speculation that led to this severe recession.
and we’re accelerating the transition to a clean energy economy by significantly raising the fuel-efficiency standards of cars and trucks, and by doubling our use of renewable energies like wind and solar power -- steps that have the potential to create whole new industries and hundreds of thousands of new jobs in america.
so, despite the forces of the status quo, despite the polarization and the frequent pettiness of our politics, we are confronting the great challenges of our times.
and while this work isn’t easy, and the changes we seek won’t always happen overnight,
what we’ve made clear is that this administration will not just kick the can down the road.
immigration reform is no exception.
in recent days, the issue of immigration has become once more a source of fresh contention in our country, with the passage of a controversial law in arizona and the heated reactions we’ve seen across america.
some have rallied behind this new policy.
others have protested and launched boycotts of the state.
and everywhere, people have expressed frustration with a system that seems fundamentally broken.
of course, the tensions around immigration are not new.
on the one hand, we’ve always defined ourselves as a nation of immigrants -- a nation that welcomes those willing to embrace america
’s precepts.
indeed, it is this constant flow of immigrants that helped to make america what it is.
the scientific breakthroughs of albert einstein, the inventions of nikola tesla
, the great ventures of andrew carnegie’s u.s. steel and sergey brin’s google, inc. -- all this was possible because of immigrants.
and then there are the countless names and the quiet acts that never made the history books but were no less consequential in building this country -- the generations who braved hardship and great risk to reach our shores in search of a better life for themselves and their families; the millions of people, ancestors to most of us, who believed that there was a place where they could be, at long last, free to work and worship and live their lives in peace.
so this steady stream of hardworking and talented people has made america the engine of the global economy and a beacon of hope around the world.
and it’s allowed us to adapt and thrive in the face of technological and societal change.
to this day, america reaps incredible economic rewards because we remain a magnet for the best and brightest from across the globe.
folks travel here in the hopes of being a part of a culture of entrepreneurship and ingenuity, and by doing so they strengthen and enrich that culture.
immigration also means we have a younger workforce -- and a faster-growing economy -- than many of our competitors.
and in an increasingly interconnected world, the diversity of our country is a powerful advantage in global competition.
just a few weeks ago, we had an event of small business owners at the white house.
and one business owner was a woman named prachee devadas who came to this country, became a citizen, and opened up a successful technology services company.
when she started, she had just one employee.
today, she employs more than a hundred people.
this past april, we held a naturalization ceremony at the white house for members of our armed forces.
even though they were not yet citizens, they had enlisted.
one of them was a woman named perla ramos -- born and raised in mexico, came to the united states shortly after 9/11, and she eventually joined the navy.
and she said, “i take pride in our flag and the history that forged this great nation and the history we write day by day.”
these women, and men and women across this country like them, remind us that immigrants have always helped to build and defend this country -- and that being an american is not a matter of blood or birth.
it’s a matter of faith.
it’s
a matter of fidelity to the shared values that we all hold so dear.
that’s what makes us unique.
that’s what makes us strong.
anybody can help us write the next great chapter in our history.
now, we can’t forget that this process of immigration and eventual inclusion has often been painful.
each new wave of immigrants has generated fear and resentments towards newcomers, particularly in times of economic upheaval.
our founding was rooted in the notion that america was unique as a place of refuge and freedom for, in thomas jefferson
’s words, “oppressed humanity.”
but the ink on our constitution was barely dry when, amidst conflict, congress passed the alien and sedition acts, which placed harsh restrictions of those suspected of having foreign allegiances.
a century ago, immigrants from ireland, italy, poland, other european countries were routinely subjected to rank discrimination and ugly stereotypes.
chinese immigrants were held in detention and deported from angel island in the san francisco bay.
they didn’t even get to come in.
so the politics of who is and who is not allowed to enter this country, and on what terms, has always been contentious.
and that remains true today.
and it’s made worse by a failure of those of us in washington to fix a broken immigration system.
to begin with, our borders have been porous for decades.
obviously, the problem is greatest along our southern border, but it’s not restricted to that part of the country.
in fact, because we don’t do a very good job of tracking who comes in and out of the country as visitors, large numbers avoid immigration laws simply by overstaying their visas.
the result is an estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the united states.
the overwhelming majority of these men and women are simply seeking a better life for themselves and their children.
many settle in low-wage sectors of the economy; they work hard, they save, they stay out of trouble.
but because they live in the shadows, they’re vulnerable to unscrupulous businesses who pay them less than the minimum wage or violate worker safety rules -- thereby putting companies who follow those rules, and americans who rightly demand the minimum wage or overtime, at an unfair
[dis]advantage.  crimes go unreported as victims and witnesses
fear coming forward.
and this makes it harder for the police to catch violent criminals and keep neighborhoods safe.
and billions in tax revenue are lost each year because many undocumented workers are paid under the table.
more fundamentally, the presence of so many illegal immigrants makes a mockery of all those who are going through the process of immigrating legally.
indeed, after years of patchwork fixes and ill-conceived revisions, the legal immigration system is as broken as the borders.
backlogs and bureaucracy means the process can take years.
while an applicant waits for approval, he or she is often forbidden from visiting the united states -- which means even husbands and wives may be forced to spend many years apart.
high fees and the need for lawyers may exclude worthy applicants.
and while we provide students from around the world visas to get engineering and computer science degrees at our top universities, our laws discourage them from using those skills to start a business or power a new industry right here in the united states.
instead of training entrepreneurs to create jobs on our shores, we train our competition.
in sum, the system is broken.
and everybody knows it.
unfortunately, reform has been held hostage to political posturing and special-interest wrangling -- and to the pervasive sentiment in washington that tackling such a thorny and emotional issue is inherently bad politics.
just a few years ago, when i was a senator, we forged a bipartisan coalition in favor of comprehensive reform.
under the leadership of senator kennedy, who had been a longtime champion of immigration reform, and senator john mccain, we worked across the aisle to help pass a bipartisan bill through the senate.
but that effort eventually came apart.
and now, under the pressures of partisanship and election-year politics, many of the 11 republican senators who voted for reform in the past have now backed away from their previous support.
into this breach, states like arizona have decided to take matters into their own hands.
given the levels of frustration across the country, this is understandable.
but it is also ill conceived.
and it’s
not just that the law arizona passed is divisive -- although it has fanned the flames of an already contentious debate.
laws like arizona’s put huge pressures on local law enforcement to enforce rules that ultimately are unenforceable.
it puts pressure on already hard-strapped state and local budgets.
it makes it difficult for people here illegally to report crimes -- driving a wedge between communities and law enforcement, making our streets more dangerous and the jobs of our police officers more difficult.
and you don’t have to take my word for this.
you can speak to the police chiefs and others from law enforcement here today who will tell you the same thing.
these laws also have the potential of violating the rights of innocent american citizens and legal residents, making them subject to possible stops or questioning because of what they look like or how they sound.
and as other states and localities go their own ways, we face the prospect that different rules for immigration will apply in different parts of the country -- a patchwork of local immigration rules where we all know one clear national standard is needed.
