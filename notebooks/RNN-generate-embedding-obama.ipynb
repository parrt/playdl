    "## Load and split into chunks\n",
    "\n",
    "The stochastic part of SGD is critical for training models. The idea is simply to use a small subset of the data when computing gradients to update the model parameters. Generally we take a small batch size of say 32 records, run that through the model, and then compute a loss. From that loss we compute the gradient and then update the model parameters and move onto the next batch.  Once all batches are complete, we have completed an epoch.  We should shuffle the batches and keep going.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also be stochastic by updating the gradient in the middle of long sequences, rather than waiting until after a complete batch of long sequences.  If the sequences are really long, waiting till the end of a batch reduces the stochastic nature. Instead I'm going to try breaking up the entire input into a small number of very long sequences. In this way the RNN can keep the hidden state going for the complete sequence. Of course the only problem is that we cannot compute back propagation that far, so at some sequence length I can update the gradient and wipe it out then continue. I think this is easier than modifying the data set stride so that a standard training loop for an RNN keeps the same hidden state across long sequences even if we have broken into chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say that we have a large text and we break it up into six chunks: A,B,C,D,E,F. then, six is our batch size and we will process each long sequence exactly once per epic. However to get stochastic nature, we will update the gradient after only a small sequence of characters.  We pick the chunk size and then the batch sizes computed instead of having to specify both. I think the chunk size is more important: how much can you store in a single hidden state vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "Come to think of it, all we need to specify is the number of chunks we want to break the text into.  There won't be any batch size because we have a single batch with `nchunks`  long records in it."
